ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS 
This
section highlights specific risks that could affect our Company and its businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the
information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those described below. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. 
If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. 
Current Economic and Political Risks 
Difficult conditions in the global capital
markets and economy generally, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the United
States and elsewhere around the world. 
Ongoing concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the mortgage and real
estate markets, sovereign debt crises, fear of a double-dip recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to uncertain expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with still relatively low levels of
business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, continue to impact global economies, which helped drive declines in credit and charge card usage and adverse changes in payment patterns by consumers and businesses. It is unclear the
degree to which the U.S. governments economic stimulus spending will foster economic growth in the United States during the remainder of 2010. This environment has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on us, in part because we are
very dependent upon consumer and business behavior. If the economy were to worsen, customer behaviors could change further. For example, Cardmembers could decide to redeem Membership Rewards points at abnormally high levels to replace cash
expenditures. 
Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, interest rates, the volatility and
strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. An economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower
business investment and lower consumer spending is likely to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the factors discussed above may cause our earnings, credit metrics and margins to
fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, and may impact the trading price of our common shares. 
The scarcity of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial markets, reduced consumer and business spending, and credit metric
performance also pose other risks to our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, we may face the following risks, among others, in connection with these events: 
The processes we use to estimate losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions,
that may no longer be capable of accurate estimation. 
Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite
credit to our customers become less predictive of future write-offs.

In the event the respective three-month average rate of excess spread earned on credit card loans and charge card receivables securitized by us falls
below certain designated levels, the securitization trusts established by us would be required to fund a cash reserve account (from cash that would normally revert back to us through the collection process), or, in the event such three-month average
should fall below zero, the securitization trusts established by us would be required to amortize earlier than scheduled, which would accelerate our need for additional funding. 
Political or economic instability in certain regions or countries could also affect our commercial or other lending activities, among other
businesses, or result in restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies. In addition, our travel network may be adversely affected by world geopolitical and other conditions. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal
discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. 
Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or
other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Similar events or other
disasters or catastrophic events in the future could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business
will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thus is likely to decline during periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues or when travel might involve health-related risks. 
If the conditions described above (or similar ones) persist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our
results of operations and financial condition. 
Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to
meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. 
The global money and capital markets, while demonstrating
generally improved conditions, remain susceptible to volatility and disruption, which could negatively impact market liquidity conditions. 
We need liquidity to pay operating expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to limit our investments in
growth opportunities or curtail operations. The principal sources of our liquidity are payments from Cardmembers, cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash,
deposits placed with the Companys U.S. banks, debt instruments such as unsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations, and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. markets. 
Notwithstanding our solid financial position, we are not immune from pressures experienced broadly across the financial markets. The
fragility of the credit markets and the current economic and regulatory environment have impacted financial services companies. Although the market for our unsecured term debt and asset securitizations has improved since the third quarter of 2009,
there is no assurance that the markets will be open to us in the future. Therefore, our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on investor demand. In addition, our
liquidity position will be impacted by our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the growth of our brokered retail CD program and brokerage sweep account program and the implementation of our direct deposit initiative. We also would have
less flexibility in accessing the commercial paper market as a short-term funding vehicle due to Credcos short-term debt rating and the volatility in the commercial paper market generally. 
In the event that current sources of liquidity, including internal sources, do not satisfy our needs, we would be required to seek
additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit and consumer deposits, the overall availability of credit to the financial services
industry, our credit ratings (which were downgraded in April 2009 by two of the major ratings agencies), and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that lenders or depositors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term
financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to an economic downturn.

Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies
take negative actions against us. While we experienced some positive credit trends in the latter half of 2009, if the performance of our charge card and credit card portfolios were to weaken through increasing delinquencies and write-offs, our
long-term and short-term debt ratings could be further downgraded and our access to capital could be materially adversely affected and our cost of capital could increase. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may
also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital necessary to grow
our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. If levels of market disruption and volatility worsen,
there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see Financial ReviewFunding Programs and Activities on pages
40-43 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
We can be adversely affected by
the impairment of other financial institutions. 
Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be
adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We routinely execute
transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies. Defaults or non-performance by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services
institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by one or more of our counterparties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. 
Any reduction in the Companys and its subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the
cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
Although the Companys and its subsidiaries long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies, the ratings of that debt have been downgraded during the second
quarter of 2009 by Moodys Investors Services (Moodys) and Standard & Poors (S&P), two of the major rating agencies. The rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and its subsidiaries, and
their ratings of the Companys and its subsidiaries long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including their financial strength as well as factors not entirely within their control, including conditions affecting
the financial services industry generally, and the wider state of the economy. There can be no assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will maintain their current respective ratings. Failure to maintain those ratings could, among other
things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the Company and its subsidiaries are able to obtain funding. 
We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take. As with other companies in the financial services industry, the Companys and
its subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies. 
Adverse currency
fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations. 
During
2009, over 32% of our revenue net of interest expense was generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and some of the revenue we generate outside the United States
is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the

69 
Table of Contents

values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control
regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could decrease the revenues we receive from our international operations and have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Legal and Regulatory Risks 
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 will significantly impact our business practices and could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. 
The CARD Act requires the Company to make fundamental changes to many of
our current business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. Among other things, the CARD Act prohibits an issuer from increasing the APR on outstanding balances (with limited exceptions), requires additional account
disclosures, provides consumers with the right to opt out of significant changes to account terms, and restricts penalty fees and charges that may be imposed by an issuer. 
Most of the requirements of the CARD Act become effective in February 2010. Additional amendments to Regulation Z revising the open-end
credit disclosure requirements become effective on July 1, 2010. Two provisions of the CARD Act do not come into effect until August 22, 2010. One of these provisions addresses the reasonableness and proportionality of penalty fees
charged. The other provision requires issuers to evaluate past interest rate increases twice per year. The Federal Reserve is required to adopt regulations implementing these provisions, but has not yet done so. Because implementing regulations are
not final, it is difficult to assess the impact of these two provisions. However, the regulations implementing these provisions could have a significant impact on our results of our operations. 
While the Company is making certain changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact of the changes
required by the CARD Act, there is no assurance that it will be successful. The long-term impact of the CARD Act on the Companys business practices and revenues will depend upon a number of factors, including its ability to successfully
implement its business strategies, consumer behavior and the actions of the Companys competitors, which are difficult to predict at this time. If the Company is not able to lessen the impact of the changes required by the CARD Act, it will
have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 
Proposed legislative and regulatory reforms could, if enacted or adopted,
result in our business becoming subject to significant and extensive additional regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
The extreme disruptions in the capital markets since mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure of numerous financial institutions
have led to numerous proposals for legislative and regulatory reform that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and that may significantly impact the Company. These proposals include the following:

Establishing a federal consumer financial protection agency that would have, among other things, broad authority to regulate, and take enforcement
actions against, providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services. 
Requiring heightened scrutiny and stricter regulation of any financial institution whose combination of size, leverage and interconnectedness could
pose a threat to financial stability if it failed, restricting the activities of such institutions, and allowing regulators to dismantle large or systemically important banks and financial institutions, even healthy ones, if they are considered a
grave risk to the economy. 
70 
Table of Contents
Requiring large financial institutions, including, as proposed, American Express, to contribute to a fund that would be used to recover the cost of
dismantling a bank or financial institution that is dismantled because it poses a grave risk to the economy. 
Changing requirements for the securitization market, including requiring sponsors of securitizations to retain a material economic interest in the
credit risk associated with the underlying securitization, as well as enhanced disclosure requirements for asset securitizations. 
Tightening controls on the ability of banking institutions to engage in transactions with affiliates. 
Assessing financial institutions with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, including, as proposed, American Express, with a financial crisis
responsibility fee assessed at approximately 0.15% of total assets (less Tier 1 capital and less FDIC-assessed deposits). The fee as proposed would last for at least the next ten years and has been proposed for the purpose of recovering
projected losses from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
Limiting the size and activities of financial institutions, including proposals to repeal portions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

Amending regulatory capital standards, and increasing regulatory capital requirements, for banks and other financial institutions, including American
Express and its insured depository institution subsidiaries, and establishing new formulaic liquidity requirements applicable to financial institutions, including those proposals described above under Supervision and RegulationProposed
Capital and Liquidity Requirements on pages 38-39. 
Establishing heightened standards for and increased scrutiny of compensation policies at financial institutions, including those proposals described
above under Supervision and RegulationsCompensation Practices on pages 44-45. 
Lawmakers
and regulators in the United States and worldwide continue to consider these and a number of other wide-ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of the nations financial
institutions. For example, separate comprehensive financial reform bills were introduced in both houses of Congress in the second half of 2009, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a financial reform bill in December of 2009, but similar
action has not been taken by the U.S. Senate. 
In addition to proposed legislation effecting the financial services industry,
our results of operations could be adversely impacted by other legislative action or inaction, including the potential failure of the U.S. Congress to extend the active financing exception to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which could
increase our effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on our net income. 
We cannot predict the final form, or effects on
American Express, of these or other potential or proposed reforms. These and other potential or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could impact the profitability of the Companys business activities, limit our ability to pursue
business opportunities, require the Company to change certain of its business practices or alter its relationships with customers, affect retention of key Company personnel, or expose the Company to additional costs (including increased compliance
costs). Such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
Please see Supervision and Regulation on pages 
35-45 for more information about the regulation to which we are subject.

Potential actions by the FDIC and the rating agencies could impact the Companys ABS program. 
The credit rating agencies are assessing the potential impact of the adoption of recently issued accounting standards for transfers of
financial assets and for consolidation of variable interest entities (the New Accounting Standards) on credit ratings of the securities issued by securitization trusts within the overall asset-backed

71 
Table of Contents

securities market. (The New Accounting Standards, previously issued as FASB Statements Nos. 166 and 167, are discussed further in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which you can
find on page 76 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders and which is incorporated herein by reference.) In particular, the agencies are assessing the FDICs safe harbor rule relating to the FDICs treatment of securitized assets in the
event of a sponsoring financial institutions receivership or conservatorship. Pursuant to the safe harbor rule, the FDIC will not reclaim any financial asset transferred in connection with a securitization, provided that such transfer meets
all conditions for GAAP sale accounting. Although the FDIC extended, on an interim basis, the safe harbor rule to some transfers of financial assets in connection with securitizations where the transfer will no longer qualify for sale accounting
treatment under GAAP as a result of the New Accounting Standards, the Company cannot predict how the FDIC will act and whether or to what extent the safe harbor rule might apply in the future. Because the adoption of the New Accounting Standards may
cause some asset transfers to securitization trusts to no longer be deemed asset sales for accounting purposes within a companys consolidated group, the rating agencies have indicated that they may ultimately conclude that the safe harbor no
longer applies and, in certain cases, that the highest rating an ABS security could receive would be based on the sponsoring banks unsecured debt rating, rather than relying on their separate evaluation of the securitization trust.
Accordingly, the ability of the Companys securitization programs to receive or maintain AAA ratings on ABS securities under the same terms and conditions as it has done in the past, or at all, is subject to uncertainty. Any action by the
rating agencies as described above could adversely impact the Companys ability to utilize ABS as a source of funding for its business. 
Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by increases in FDIC deposit insurance assessments. 
FDIC deposit insurance assessments have become considerably higher recently because market developments have significantly depleted the FDIC deposit insurance fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to
insured deposits. The failure of additional insured depository institutions could result in further depletion of the deposit insurance fund. Assessments may continue to increase, and special assessments may be levied, until the value of the fund has
returned to levels the FDIC determines appropriate. We generally cannot control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the FDIC will increase deposit insurance assessments
further or whether the FDIC will levy additional special assessments. Further increase in assessments, or imposition of special assessments, by the FDIC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulation and supervision to which we
are subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company. 
On November 14, 2008, American Express Company and
TRS each became bank holding companies under the BHC Act and have elected to be treated as financial holding companies under the BHC Act. As a result of becoming a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve, including,
without limitation, consolidated capital regulation at the holding company level, maintenance of certain capital and management standards in connection with our two U.S. depository institutions and restrictions on our non-banking activities under
the Federal Reserves regulations. For additional information about this change in regulatory status, please see Supervision and RegulationGeneral beginning on page 35 above. 
If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements applicable to bank holding companies, our financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected. 
We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock.

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends by our regulators who could prohibit a dividend that would be
considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if

72 
Table of Contents

prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs, asset quality, and financial condition. For more information on bank holding company dividend
restrictions, please see Financial ReviewShare Repurchases and Dividends on page 40 and Note 23 on page 119 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
Banks, card issuers and card network operators generally are the subject of increasing global regulatory focus, which may impose costly new compliance
burdens on our Company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and revenues through our network. 
We are subject to
regulations that affect banks and the payments industry in the United States and many other countries in which our charge and credit Cards are used and where we conduct banking and Card activities. In particular, we are subject to numerous
regulations applicable to financial institutions in the United States and abroad. We are also subject to regulations as a provider of services to financial institutions. Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent
years. For example, we are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional
obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our charge and credit Cards may be used, and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our charge
and credit Cards. In addition, the European Union has adopted a new legislative directive, called the Payment Services Directive, for electronic payment services, including cards, that puts in place a common legal framework for licensing and
supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business. 
The U.S. Congress is also presently considering, or may consider, legislative initiatives in the area of Internet transactions, such as Internet prescription drug purchases and copyright and trademark infringement, among others, that could
impose additional compliance burdens on our Company. Federal and state law enforcement authorities have also contacted payment companies concerning these issues. If implemented, these initiatives may require us to monitor, filter, restrict, or
otherwise oversee various categories of charge and credit card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering
identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge
and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations and legislation could have the effect of limiting our ability to offer new types of charge or credit
cards or restricting our ability to offer existing Cards, such as stored value cards, which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth. 
In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the United States have focused on the fees involved in the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers and the fees
merchants are charged to accept cards. Regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, the European Union (EU), Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela, among others, have conducted
investigations that are either ongoing or on appeal. The interchange fee, which is the collectively set fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in four party payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard, is
generally the largest component of the merchant service charge charged to merchants for bankcard debit and credit card acceptance in these systems. By contrast, the American Express network does not have collectively set interchange fees. Although
the regulators focus has primarily been on Visa and MasterCard as the dominant card networks and on their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard associations pricing could
ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue such as higher annual card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or
eliminating rewards programs. 
73 
Table of Contents
In the United States, Congress continues to debate the interchange issue. There have been
several hearings on Visa/MasterCard interchange over the last several years, and in 2009 at the request of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) completed a study on the structure of interchange fees and their impact on consumers and
merchants. The report provides a balanced view of the interchange issue and explains how large merchants would benefit and how consumers could be harmed by the pending legislative proposals. In 2009, legislation was reintroduced in Congress that
would give all U.S. merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate collectively the price and terms of card acceptance on networks. The House Judiciary Committee bill covers networks with at least a 20% share of U.S. credit and debit card payments
combined, which would not apply to the American Express network but, if enacted, would have an effect on American Express in the marketplace. The Senate version of the bill covers networks with at least 10% of U.S. credit or debit payments, which
would apply to American Express. Both bills have a default process for having prices and terms set through government action rather than competitive forces. A similar version of the House bill (the Credit Card Fair Fee Act) was passed in
the House Judiciary Committee in 2008. No action was taken on either of these bills in 2009. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on a third piece of interchange-related legislation that was reintroduced in 2009 (the Credit
Card Interchange Fees Act), a bill that would regulate payment network rules, including the American Express network. No further action was taken on this bill. It is expected that Congressional hearings will continue in 2010 on the interchange
issue. The Federal Reserve and various Federal Reserve Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferences focused on interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest in monitoring this issue,
it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the United States. 
Increased regulatory focus on our Company,
such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may increase our compliance costs or result in a reduction of transactions processed on our networks or merchant discount revenues from such transactions, which could materially and adversely
impact our results of operations. 
If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, and invest successfully in, and compete at
the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected. 
Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in business process and technology advances across all areas of
our business, including in transaction processing, data management, customer interactions and communications, travel reservations systems, prepaid products, alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems. We rely in part
on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new
technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our Cards, networks and other services. Our ability to develop, acquire, or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may be
limited by patent rights that third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide standards or by resistance from
Cardmembers or merchants to such changes. 
We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and
proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents and controls on access and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss
of competitive advantage. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and
business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation, we cannot assure you that a future assertion of an infringement claim against us will not cause us to lose significant
revenues, incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant monetary damages.

Regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs and decrease the number
of charge and credit cards issued. 
We are subject to regulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we
could be negatively impacted by these regulations. For example, in the United States, we are subject to the data security rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The data security rule requires that each financial institution develop, implement, and
maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities, and the
sensitivity of any customer information at issue. 
Further, a growing number of states, including, notably, Massachusetts and
Nevada, have adopted broad-ranging data security regulations regarding the protection of customer and employee data that could result in higher compliance and technology costs for the Company, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties
for non-compliance. 
Many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate are also expanding the scope of their data security
requirements and standards, as well as increasing enforcement activity in this area. In 1995, the European Parliament and Council passed European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and
on the free movement of such data (commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an individuals personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. The
Data Protection Directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in European Union Member States. As these laws expand throughout the European Union where we have a significant commercial presence, compliance costs are
increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data privacy protections and data transfer mechanisms are in place. 
In addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as many as 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data breach regulations and
laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Data breach laws are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate, including Japan, Mexico and Germany. In many countries that
have yet to impose automatic data breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data breaches.
Many of these regulations also apply broadly to retailers/merchants that accept our cards; thus, to the extent they experience data security breaches, this presents additional risks for American Express and our Cardmembers. The heightened
legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach, continues. The current 111th Congress will likely consider data security/data breach legislation in 2010 that, if
implemented, could present new risks and costs for us. 
We continue to seek ways to minimize these risks and costs internally
by improving our own data privacy and security policies and practices, and externally through regular improvements to the PCI Data Security Standard and by placing strong contractual obligations on retailers/merchants that accept our Cards, as well
as on our service providers, relating to data security and data breach. Still, increased regulation and enforcement activity throughout the world in the areas of data privacy and data security/breach may materially increase our costs and may
decrease the number of our Cards that we issue, or restrict our ability to fully exploit our closed-loop capability, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with the privacy and data security/breach laws
and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, and damage to our global reputation and our brand. 
Our
success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business. 
Our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Our senior management
team is

75 
Table of Contents

relatively small and we believe we are in a critical period of competition in the financial services and payments industry. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may
not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. As further described in Supervision and RegulationCompensation Practices on
pages 44-45, our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve. As a large financial and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices, which may or may not affect our
competitors, by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or other regulators worldwide. These limitations, including any incentive compensation policies, could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The
loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business. 
Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant
fines, penalties and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses. 
Businesses in the credit card industry have
historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits and patent claims. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. In addition, we may be involved in various
actions or proceedings brought by governmental regulatory agencies in the event of noncompliance with laws or regulations, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses and damage to our
global reputation and our brand. 
Business Risks 
Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry. 
The payments industry is highly competitive and includes, in addition to charge and credit card networks, evolving alternative payment
mechanisms and systems. We are the third largest general-purpose charge and credit card network based on charge volume, behind Visa and MasterCard, which are larger than we are in most markets. As a result, other card issuers may be able to benefit
from the strong position and marketing and pricing power of Visa and MasterCard. Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there are now a
smaller number of significant issuers. Continuing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a strong relationship with us being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor,
resulting in a potential loss of business for us. The largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail branch networks, and competition among all issuers
remains intense. We are also subject to increasing pricing pressure from our competitors. 
In addition, some of our
competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve
broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have. We may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats. 
Our competitors may also be more efficient in introducing innovative products, programs and services than we are. Spending on our Cards could be impacted by consumer usage of debit cards, as we do not
currently issue point-of-sale debit cards for use on the American Express Network. In fact, the purchase volume and number of transactions made with debit cards in the United States has grown more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions. In
addition, to the extent alternative payment mechanisms and systems, such as aggregators, continue to successfully expand in the online payments space, our merchant revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network
could be negatively impacted. 
Regulators have recently put forward various proposals that may impact our businesses,
including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions, and proposals to impose taxes or fees on certain financial institutions. These or
similar proposals, which may not apply to all of our competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.

We face increasingly intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants who
accept our Cards for payment for goods and services. 
Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high
revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on Cardmember spending. Discount revenue, which represents fees charged to merchants when Cardmembers use their Cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is
primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. In recent years, we have been under market pressure to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. This pressure arises, in part, due
to the regulatory pressure on our competitors outside the United States, which has been increasing. If we continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate we charge merchants or are unable to sustain premium merchant discount
rates on our Cards without experiencing overall volume growth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected. 
We may not be successful in our efforts to promote Card usage through our marketing, promotion and rewards programs or to effectively control the costs of such programs, both of which may impact our
profitability. 
Our business is characterized by the high level of spending by our Cardmembers. Increasing consumer and
business spending and borrowing on our payment services products, particularly credit and charge Cards and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, and growth in Card lending balances, depend in part on our ability to develop and issue new or
enhanced Card and prepaid products and increase revenues from such products. One of the ways in which we attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember attrition and seek to capture a greater share of customers total spending on Cards issued on
our network, both in the United States and in our international operations, is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Cardmember benefits. We may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand Cardmember benefits, including
containing the growth of marketing, promotion and rewards expenses and Cardmember services expenses. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and co-brand programs that are similar to ours, and issuers may in the future
institute programs that are more attractive to cardmembers than our programs. 
Our ability to continue to invest in marketing,
promotion and rewards programs, as well as our overall profitability, may be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace the payments provided to us under our previously disclosed litigation settlements with Visa and MasterCard once the
aggregate settlement amounts have been paid in full through the fourth and second quarters of 2011, respectively. 
Our brand and
reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace. 
Our brand and its attributes are key assets of the Company. Our ability to attract and retain consumer Cardmembers and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business
practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential Cardmembers and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Cardmembers
and maintain existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Although we monitor
developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 
An increase in account data breaches and fraudulent activity using our Cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit Cards.

We and other third parties store Cardmember account information in connection with our charge and credit Cards.
Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture various types of information relating to Cardmembers accounts, including Membership Rewards accounts, to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft. As
outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable and common way of doing business in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our Cards. If data breaches or fraud levels involving our Cards
were to rise, it could lead to regulatory intervention

(such as mandatory card reissuance) and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our Cards, and have a material adverse impact on our business.

We have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant
portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and alliances of our partners, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.

In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business
partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Costco and Delta Air Lines to offer co-branded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many
industries, most notably the airline industry, to offer benefits to Cardmember participants. The airline industry represents a significant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations
and other similar events. In addition, under some types of these contractual arrangements, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers. If we
are not able to effectively manage the triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, we have credit risk to
certain co-brand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty program points that will not be fully redeemed for multi-year periods. We are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may
occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed business generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. For example,
we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse Cardmembers for products and services purchased from merchants that are bankrupt or have ceased operations. 
There could be continued significant consolidation in the airline industry, particularly in the United States, through mergers and/or grants
of antitrust immunity to airline alliances and joint ventures. The United States Department of Transportation has granted antitrust immunity to members of the Skyteam Alliance and the Star Alliance, enabling them to closely coordinate their
international operations and to launch highly integrated joint ventures in transatlantic and other markets. The Department of Transportation has granted preliminary approval of a similar request by members of the Oneworld Alliance for antitrust
immunity. Among other things, this immunity permits alliance members to jointly price and manage capacity on covered routes, share revenues and costs, and coordinate sales and corporate contracts, outside of the scope of the antitrust laws. The
European Commissions review of each of these alliances is continuing. Increasing consolidation and expanded antitrust immunity could create challenges for our relationships with the airlines including by reducing our profitability on our
airline business. Airlines are also some of the most important and valuable partners in our Membership Rewards program. If a participating airline merged with an airline that did not participate in Membership Rewards, the combined airline would have
to determine whether or not to continue participation. Similarly, if one of our co-brand airline partners merged with an airline that had a competing co-brand card, the combined airline would have to determine which co-brand cards it would offer. If
a surviving airline determined to withdraw from Membership Rewards or to cease offering an American Express co-brand card, our business could be adversely affected. For additional information relating to the agreements with Delta and general risks
related to the airline industry, see Financial ReviewExposure to Airline Industry on page 60 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is hereby incorporated by reference. 
Our reengineering and other cost control initiatives may not prove successful, and we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we
intended. 
We have regularly undertaken, and are currently undertaking, a variety of efforts to reengineer our business
operations in order to achieve cost savings and other benefits (including the reinvestment of such savings in key areas such as marketing, promotion, rewards and infrastructure), enhance revenue-generating opportunities and

78 
Table of Contents

improve our operating expense to revenue ratio both in the short-term and over time. These efforts include cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities
and operations consolidation, outsourcing functions (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the Internet to save costs and planned
staff reductions relating to certain of these reengineering actions. If we do not successfully achieve these efforts in a timely manner or if we are not able to capitalize on these efforts, including the ability of the Global Services Group to
generate an annualized level of gross expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2012, we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we intended. Failure to achieve these benefits could have a negative effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. 
Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective. 
We must effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, settlement risk with regard to GNS partners, merchant
bankruptcies, the rate of bankruptcies, and other credit trends that can affect spending on Card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept our Card products. 
Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. We are exposed to both consumer credit risk, principally from
Cardmember receivables and our other consumer lending activities, and institutional credit risk from merchants, GNS partners and GCC clients. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational
failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks are components of credit risk. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses.
Higher write-off rates and an increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds. 
Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be
accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that
we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the credit risks of our customers.

We must also effectively manage market risk to which we are exposed. Market risk represents the loss in value of portfolios
and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables. We are exposed to market risk from interest rates in our Card business and in our investment portfolios. Changes in the interest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the
value of our assets and liabilities. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net income, could fall. 
We must also accurately estimate the fair value of the assets in our investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not
readily marketable. 
Additionally, we must effectively manage liquidity risk to which we are exposed. Liquidity risk is
defined as the inability to access cash and equivalents needed to meet business requirements and satisfy our obligations. If we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk, we may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit
financial flexibility, or we may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during a liquidity event. For additional information regarding our management of liquidity risk, see Adverse capital and credit market conditions may
significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital above. 
Finally, we must
also manage the operational risks to which we are exposed. We consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving our business objectives due to failed processes, people or information systems, or from the external environment, such as natural
disasters. Operational risks include the risk that we may not

79 
Table of Contents

comply with specific regulatory or legal requirements, exposing us to fines and/or penalties and possibly brand damage; employee error or intentional misconduct that results in a material
financial misstatement; or a failure to monitor an outsource partners compliance with a service level agreement, resulting in economic harm to us. 
Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, our hedging strategies and other risk management
techniques may not be fully effective. See 
Financial ReviewRisk Management on pages 
47-49 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify, monitor and
manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Management of credit, market and operational risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these
policies and procedures may not be fully effective. 
An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory
constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business. 
As an
additional source of funding, our banking subsidiaries offer deposits to individuals through brokerage networks as well as directly to consumers. 
As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $26.3 billion in total customer deposits, a large portion of which was raised through brokerage networks. Many other financial services firms are
increasing their use of deposit funding, and as such we may experience increased competition in the deposit markets, particularly as to brokerage networks. We cannot predict how this increased competition will affect deposit renewal rates, costs or
availability. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. 
Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiaries. The FDIA generally prohibits a bank, including our
banking subsidiaries, from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless
(1) it is well-capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit, including direct-to-consumer deposits, in
excess of 75 basis points over the national rate published by the FDIC. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance provision within a written agreement, consent
order, order to cease and desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its federal regulator). While we met the FDICs definition of well-capitalized as of December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2009, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet this definition. Additionally, our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well-capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses, including
the interest rate we pay on deposits. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business. 
If our global network systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all, our revenue and profitability would be
materially reduced. 
Our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems may experience service
interruptions as a result of fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism or accident. A natural disaster or other problem at our facilities could interrupt our services.
Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster,
operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services, adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenue and profitability.

We rely on third-party providers of various computer systems and other services integral to the
operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business. 
We operate a service
network around the world. In order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors many of the computer systems and other services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses. A significant amount
of this outsourcing occurs in developing countries. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. In addition, the
management of multiple third-party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control. It is also possible that the cost efficiencies of certain outsourcings will decrease as the demand for these services increases around the
world.

PROPERTIES 
Our principal
executive offices are in a 51-story, 2.2 million square foot building located in lower Manhattan. This building, which is on land leased from the Battery Park City Authority for a term expiring in 2069, is one of four office buildings in a
complex known as the World Financial Center. We have a 49% ownership interest in the building. Brookfield Financial Properties owns the remaining 51% interest in the building. We also lease space in the building from Brookfield. 
Other owned or leased principal locations include: the American Express Service Centers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona;
Greensboro, North Carolina; and Salt Lake City, Utah; the American Express Data Centers in Phoenix, Arizona and in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the American Express Finance Center in Phoenix, Arizona; the headquarters for American Express Services Europe
Limited in London, England; the Amex Canada Inc. headquarters in Markham, Ontario, Canada; and service centers located in Mexico City, Mexico; Sydney, Australia; Gurgaon, India and Brighton, United Kingdom. 
During 2004 and 2005, we engaged in several sale-leaseback transactions pursuant to which we sold various owned properties to third parties
and leased back the properties under long-term net leases whereby each American Express entity that leases back the property is responsible for all costs and expenses relating to the property (including maintenance, repair, utilities, operating
expenses and insurance costs) in addition to annual rent. The sale-leaseback transactions have not materially impacted our financial results in any year. Gains resulting from completed sale and leaseback transactions are amortized over the initial
ten-year lease periods. We continue to consider whether sale-leaseback transactions are appropriate for other properties that we currently own.

ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
The
Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings, including class actions, concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their respective business activities. The Company believes it has
meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them vigorously. In the course of its business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to governmental examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries
and investigations. The Company believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration, regulatory, tax or investigative proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, it is possible that the outcome of any such proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved.
Certain legal proceedings involving the Company are described below. 
Corporate Matters 
Beginning in mid-July 2002, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. In October 2002, these cases were consolidated under the caption 
In re American Express Company Securities Litigation
. These lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and the common law in connection
with alleged misstatements regarding certain investments in high-yield bonds and write-downs in the 2000-2001 timeframe. The purported class covers the period from July 26, 1999 to July 17, 2001. The actions seek unspecified
compensatory damages as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs, and interest. On March 31, 2004, the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In August 2006, the Court of Appeals, without expressing any views whatsoever on the merits of the cases, vacated the District Courts judgment and remanded all claims to the
District Court for further proceedings. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 5, 2007. The Company subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which motion was granted in September 2008. Plaintiffs
have appealed the dismissal. 
On November 24, 2009, a putative class action captioned 
Amick v. American Express Travel
Related Services Co.
, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to recover unpaid wages and overtime compensation at one of the Companys call centers. The Plaintiff seeks to represent all similarly
situated employees in a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and in a Rule 23 class action under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act. On January 26, 2010, the Court granted the Companys motion to
transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. 
In May 2008, a
shareholders derivative suit was filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan naming American Express Company and certain current and former directors and senior executives as defendants. The case captioned as 
City of Tallahassee
Retirement System v. Akerson et al.
 alleges breaches of fiduciary duty arising from knowing breaches of fiduciary obligations by certain current and former officers and directors of the Company that have led to the imposition of deferred
criminal charges on a bank that at the time such charges were entered was owned by American Express, as well as the Companys payment of approximately $65 million in penalties to federal and state regulators related to American Express
Bank Limiteds (AEBL) and TRSs anti-money laundering programs. The complaint also states that the sale of AEBL took place after American Express had allowed the value of its banking business unit to be dramatically impaired on
account of the systemic violations of law and resulting deferred criminal charges. The complaint seeks monetary damages on behalf of the Company. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and in October 2009, the Court
dismissed the complaint against all defendants. The plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal of the dismissal. 
82 
Table of Contents
In December 2008, a putative class action captioned 
Obester v. American Express Company,
et. al.
 was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated certain ERISA obligations by: allowing the investment of American Express Retirement Savings Plan
assets in American Express common stock when American Express common stock was not a prudent investment; misrepresenting and failing to disclose material facts to Plan participants in connection with the administration of the Plan; and breaching
certain fiduciary obligations. The Company is also a defendant in three other putative class actions making allegations similar to those made in the Obester matter: 
Tang v. American Express Company, et. al.
, filed on December 29, 2008 in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 
Miner v. American Express Company et. al.
, filed on February 4, 2009 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and 
DiLorenzo v.
American Express Company et. al.
, filed on February 10, 2009 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. American Express has filed a motion to dismiss these actions. In April 2009, these actions were
consolidated into a Consolidated Amended complaint, captioned 
In Re American Express ERISA Litigation
. American Express motion to dismiss this action is pending with the Court. 
On February 20, 2009, a putative class action captioned, 
Brozovich v. American Express Co., Kenneth I. Chenault and Daniel T.
Henry
, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with certain alleged misstatements regarding the credit quality of the
Companys credit card customers. The purported class covered the period from March 1, 2007 to November 12, 2008. The action sought unspecified damages and costs and fees. The Brozovich action was subsequently
voluntarily dismissed. On March 27, 2009, a putative class action, captioned 
Baydale v. American Express Co., Kenneth I. Chenault and Daniel Henry
, which makes similar allegations to those made in the Brozovich action, was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 13, 2009, plaintiff in the Baydale action filed an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint in the action. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss and that
motion is pending with the Court. 
U.S. Card Services and Global Merchant Services Matters 
Beginning July 2003 the Company has been named in a number of putative class actions in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust
tying arrangement between certain of the Companys charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. These cases have since all been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under
the caption: 
In re American Express Merchants Litigation
. A case making similar allegations was also filed in the Southern District of New York in July 2004 captioned: 
The Marcus Corporation v. American Express
Company et al.
, The Marcus case is not consolidated. The plaintiffs in these actions seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. On April 30, 2004, the Company filed a motion to dismiss all the actions filed prior to
the date of its motion. On March 15, 2006, that motion was granted, with the Court finding the claims of the plaintiffs to be subject to arbitration. Plaintiffs asked the Court to reconsider its dismissal. That request was
denied. The plaintiffs appealed the Courts arbitration ruling and on January 30, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court. The Company has filed with the United States Supreme
Court a petition of certiorari from the Second Circuits arbitration ruling. That petition is pending. The Company also filed a motion to dismiss the action filed by the Marcus Corporation, which was denied in July 2005. On
October 1, 2007, Marcus filed a motion seeking certification of a class. On March 30, 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification without prejudice to renew upon resolution of the pending summary
judgment motion. In April 2009, the Court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the March 30th order. In September 2008, American Express moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Marcus complaint and the plaintiff
Marcus cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. A decision on the summary judgment motions is pending. One case making similar allegations was filed and remains in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County
(filed December 2003). The Company continues to request the California Superior Court hearing the Hayama action referenced above to stay that action. To date the Hayama action has been stayed.

Table of Contents
On February 19, 2009, an amended complaint was filed in 
In Re: American Express
Merchants Litigation
. The amended complaint contains a single count alleging a violation of federal antitrust laws through an alleged unlawful tying of: (a) corporate, small business and/or personal charge card services; and
(b) Blue, Costco and standard GNS credit card services. In addition, on February 19, 2009, a new complaint making the same allegations as made in the amended complaint filed in 
In Re: American Express Merchants
Litigation
 was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That new case is captioned: 
Greenporter LLC and Bar Hama LLC, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. American Express
Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.
 Proceedings in the Greenporter action and on the amended complaint filed in In Re: American Express Merchants Litigation have been held in abeyance pending the disposition
of the motions for summary judgment in the Marcus case. 
Beginning August 2005, the Company has been named in a number of
putative class actions alleging that the Companys policy prohibiting merchants from imposing restrictions on the use of American Express Cards violates U.S. antitrust laws. These cases are now all consolidated in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York under the caption: 
In Re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation
. The plaintiffs complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. These plaintiffs have agreed
that a stay would be imposed with regard to their respective actions pending the appeal of the Courts arbitration ruling discussed above. Given the ruling of the Second Circuit (discussed above), the stay has been lifted, and American
Expresss response to the complaint was filed in April 2009. On December 1, 2009, the United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied the plaintiffs motion to consolidate their cases with the individual suits discussed
below pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a scheduling order on December 28, 2009. 
In June 2008, five separate lawsuits were filed against American Express Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
New York alleging that the Companys anti-steering rules in its merchant acceptance agreements violate federal antitrust laws. As alleged by the plaintiffs, these rules prevent merchants from offering consumers
incentives to use alternative forms of payments when consumers wish to use an American Express-branded card. The five suits were filed by each of Rite-Aid Corp., CVS Pharmacy Inc., Walgreen Co., Bi-Lo LLC., and H.E. Butt Grocery Company. The
plaintiff in each action seeks damages and injunctive relief. American Express filed its answer to these complaints and also filed a motion to dismiss these complaints as time barred. The Court has not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss and
entered a scheduling order on January 26, 2010. 
In July, 2009, a putative class action, captioned 
The Wild Grape v.
American Express Company, et al.
, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint challenges American Expresss policy of retaining the discount charged to certain merchants when underlying
purchases are returned to the merchant by an American Express cardmember for a refund. The complaint seeks certification of a California-only class. American Express has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. 
In June 2009, a putative class action, captioned 
Mesi v. American Express Centurion Bank
, was filed in U.S. District Court for the
Central District of California. The complaint seeks to certify a class of American Express cardmembers with billing addresses in 16 different states whose interest rates on their outstanding balances were retroactively increased by the
Company. The complaint seeks, among other things, damages in excess of $5,000,000 and unspecified injunctive relief. The complaint has been amended twice by plaintiff. On December 7, 2009, the Court ordered that the matter be stayed
pending decisions on relevant legal issues in other cases not involving American Express. 
In October 2009, a putative class
action, captioned 
Lopez, et al. v. American Express Bank, FSB and American Express Centurion Bank
, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint seeks to certify a nationwide class of American
Express cardmembers whose interest rates were changed from fixed to variable in or around August 2009 or otherwise increases. American Express filed a motion to compel arbitration, and plaintiff has indicated they will amend their complaint to limit
the class to California residents only.

In January 2006, in a matter captioned
 Hoffman, et al. v. American Express Travel
Related Services Company, Inc.
, No. 2001-02281, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, the Court certified a class action against TRS. In a case management order dated April 8, 2008, the Court defined
two classes as follows: (1) all persons who obtained American Express charge cards governed by New York law with billing addresses in California who purchased American Express fee based travel related insurance plans from
September 6, 1995, through February 12, 2008, and (2) all persons who obtained American Express charge cards governed by New York law with billing addresses in states other than California who purchased American Express fee
based travel related insurance plans from September 6, 1995, through February 12, 2008. The Court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify a class to pursue claims on behalf of persons who held American Express credit cards
governed by Utah law. Plaintiffs allege that American Express violated California and New York law by allegedly billing customers for flight and baggage insurance that they did not receive. American Express denies the
allegations. American Express filed a motion for summary judgment asking that the case be dismissed as a matter of law. The summary judgment motion was partially granted in July 2008 when the Court dismissed certain claims against
American Express including claims for punitive damages. Certain other claims survived summary judgment. A trial on the remaining claims began in November 2008. The Company prevailed in Phase 1 of that trial with the Court ruling
that the contract between the Company and its cardmembers was not ambiguous and that the Company operated the air-flight and baggage insurance program consistent with the contract. On March 25, 2009, the Court entered a preliminary order
in the Companys favor in Phase 2 of the trial, finding that: (1) the contract is not unconscionable; (2) the Company did not violate California consumer protection laws; and (3) the Company did not violate New York consumer
protection laws. The Court also awarded as-yet-to-be-determined costs to the Company. Plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal in the case. In addition, a matter making related allegations to those raised in the Hoffman case is pending in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. That matter, captioned 
Environment Law Enforcement Systems v. American Express et al.
, has effectively been stayed pending the proceedings in the Hoffman
action. Following the favorable March 25, 2009, ruling in Hoffman, the plaintiff in Environmental Law Enforcement Systems asked the Court to lift the stay and to allow plaintiff to obtain certain cardmember information. The Company
opposed that request, and the Court denied the request. Lastly, on October 30, 2008, a case making allegations similar to those raised in the Hoffman case was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida. That matter, captioned 
Kass v. American Express Card Services, Inc., American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services
, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of American Express credit card
holders. On March 11, 2009, the Kass Court entered an order granting the joint motion of the parties to stay the case, and the Court also administratively closed the case. 
In July 2004, a purported class action captioned 
Ross, et al. v. American Express Company, American Express Travel Related Services
and American Express Centurion Bank
 was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that American Express conspired with Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club in the setting of foreign conversion
rates and in the inclusion of arbitration clauses in certain of their cardmember agreements. The suit seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The class is defined as all Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general-purpose
cardholders who used cards issued by any of the MDL Defendant Banks. American Express cardholders are not part of the class. In September 2005, the Court denied the Companys motion to dismiss the action and preliminarily
certified an injunction class of Visa and MasterCard cardholders to determine the validity of Visas and MasterCards cardmember arbitration clauses. American Express filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court, which
motion was denied in September 2006. The Company filed an appeal from the District Courts order denying its motion to compel arbitration. In October 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the
Companys appeal and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 22, 2010, the Court (1) certified a damage class of all Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general purpose cardholders who used cards
issued by any of the alleged co-conspiring banks during the period July 22, 2000 to November 8, 2006, and who were assessed a foreign transaction fee or surcharge and who have submitted valid claims in 
In Re Currency Conversion
Antitrust Litigation.
; and (2) the Court denied American Express motion to amend its answer to add the affirmative defense of release.

Table of Contents
In June 2006, a putative class action captioned 
Homa v. American Express Company et
al.
 was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case alleges, generally, misleading and fraudulent advertising of the tiered up to 5 percent cash rebates with the Blue Cash card. The
complaint initially sought certification of a nationwide class consisting of all persons who applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present and who did not get the
rebate or rebates provided for in the offer. On December 1, 2006, however, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint dropping the nationwide class claims and asserting claims only on behalf of New Jersey residents who while so
residing in New Jersey, applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other unspecified relief that the Court deems
appropriate. In May 2007, the Court granted the Companys motion to compel individual arbitration and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and on
February 24, 2009, the Third Circuit reversed the decision and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. On October 22, 2009, a putative class action captioned 
Pagsolingan v. American Express Company
, et
al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. That case makes allegations that are largely similar to those made in Homa, except that Pagsolingan alleges multiple theories of liability and seeks to certify a
nationwide class of [a]ll persons who applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present and who did not get the rebate or rebates provided for in the offer.

In January 2009, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding to resolve claims raised in a putative class action
captioned 
Kaufman v. American Express Travel Related Services
, pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Since such time, the parties have entered into a settlement agreement that was submitted to the
Court for preliminary approval, and a final ruling on preliminary approval remains pending. The allegations in Kaufman relate primarily to monthly service fee charges, with the critical claim being that the Companys gift card product violates
consumer protection statutes because consumers allegedly have difficulty spending small residual amounts on the gift cards prior to the imposition of monthly service fees. The proposed Settlement Class consists of All purchasers, recipients
and holders of all gift cards issued by American Express from January 1, 2002 through the date of preliminary approval of the Settlement, including without limitation, gift cards sold at physical retail locations, via the internet, or through
mall co-branded programs. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, in addition to certain non-monetary relief, the Company would pay $3 million into a settlement fund. Members of the settlement class would then be entitled to submit claims
against the settlement fund to receive refunds of certain gift card fees, and any monies remaining in the settlement fund after payment of all claims would be paid to charity. In addition, the Company would make available to the settlement class for
a period of time the opportunity to buy gift cards with no purchase fee. Finally, the Company would be responsible for paying class counsels reasonable fees and expenses and certain expenses of administering the class settlement. The Company
is also a defendant in two other putative class actions making allegations similar to those made in Kaufman: 
Goodman v. American Express Travel Related Services
, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York, and 
Jarratt v. American Express Company
, filed in California state court in San Diego. If the Kaufman settlement ultimately receives final approval, all related gift cards claims and suits would also be released. 
International Matters 
In
May 2006, in a matter captioned 
Marcotte v. Bank of Montreal et al.
, filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in April 2003) the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Bank
of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Scotiabank, National Bank of Canada, Laurentian Bank of Canada and Citibank Canada. The action alleges that conversion commissions made on foreign currency
transactions are credit charges under the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (the QCPA) and cannot be charged prior to the 21-day grace period under the QCPA. The class includes all persons holding a credit card issued by one of the defendants to
whom fees were charged since April 17, 2000, for transactions made in foreign currency before expiration of the period of 21 days following the statement of account. The class claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversions,

86 
Table of Contents

CDN$400 per class member for trouble, inconvenience and punitive damages, interest and fees and costs. The trial in the 
Marcotte
 action commenced in September 2008 and was
completed in November. The Court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against Amex Bank of Canada on June 11, 2009, and awarded damages in the amount of CDN$7.1 million plus interest on the QCPA claims and individual claims to be made
on the non-disclosure claims. In addition, the Court awarded punitive damages in the amount of CDN$21.52 per cardmember. The judgment has been appealed by all banks, including Amex Bank of Canada. The appeal is expected to be heard by the Quebec
Court of Appeal in the fall of 2011. 
In November 2006, in a matter captioned 
Sylvan Adams v. Amex Bank of Canada

filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in November 2004), the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that prior to December 2003, Amex Bank of Canada
charged a foreign currency conversion commission on transactions to purchase goods and services in currencies other than Canadian dollars and failed to disclose the commissions in monthly billing statements or solicitations directed to prospective
cardmembers. The class, consisting of all Cardmembers in Quebec that purchased goods or services in a foreign currency prior to December 2003, claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversion commissions, CDN$1,000 in punitive
damages per class member, interest and fees and costs. The trial in the 
Adams
 action commenced, and was completed, in December 2008 after the conclusion of the trial in the 
Marcotte
 action. The Court rendered a judgment in
favor of the plaintiffs against Amex Bank of Canada on June 11, 2009, and awarded damages in the amount of CDN$11.2 million plus interest on the non-disclosure claims. In addition, the Court awarded punitive damages in the amount of CDN$2.2
million. The judgment has been appealed by Amex Bank of Canada. The appeal is expected to be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal in the fall of 2011. 
In November 2006, in a matter captioned 
Option Consommateurs and Benoit Fortin v. Amex Bank of Canada et al.
 filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in July
2003), the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Citibank Canada, MBNA Canada, Diners Club International, Capital One and Royal Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants have violated the Quebec Consumer
Protection Act (QCPA) by imposing finance charges on credit card transactions prior to 21 days following the receipt of the statement containing the charge. It is alleged that the QCPA provisions which require a 21-day grace period prior
to imposing finance charges applies to credit cards issued by Amex Bank of Canada in Quebec and that finance charges imposed prior to this grace period violate the Act. The class seeks reimbursement of all finance charges imposed in violation of the
Act, CDN$200 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs. 
In May 2005, Amex Bank of Canada was added as
a defendant to a motion to authorize a class action captioned 
Option Consommateurs and Joel-Christian St-Pierre v. Bank of Montreal et al.
 filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Quebec. The motion, which also names as defendants
Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, HSBC Bank of Canada, among others, alleges that the defendants violated QCPA by imposing finance charges on credit card transactions prior to 21 days following the receipt of the statement containing the
charge. It is alleged that the QCPA provisions, which require a 21-day grace period prior to imposing finance charges, applies to credit cards issued by Amex Bank of Canada in Quebec and that finance charges imposed prior to this grace period
violate the QCPA. The proposed class seeks reimbursement of all finance charges imposed in violation of the QCPA, CDN$100 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs. 
Other Matters 
During the
last few years as regulatory interest in credit card network pricing to merchants and related issues has increased, the Company has responded to many inquiries from banking and competition authorities throughout the world. On October 14, 2008,
the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID), dated October 10, 2008, from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). A CID is a request for information in the course of a civil
investigation and does not constitute the commencement of legal

87 
Table of Contents

proceedings. The DOJ is permitted by statute to issue a CID to anyone whom it believes may have information relevant to an investigation. The receipt of a CID does not presuppose that
there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the antitrust laws has occurred or that a formal complaint ultimately will be filed. The DOJ has requested the production of documents and information regarding the Companys policies
relating to merchant surcharging and its anti-steering policies that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the Card in favor of other forms of payment. The Company is cooperating with the DOJs request. The Company has also
received a similar civil investigative demand from the attorney general of the state of Ohio. These investigations are ongoing.

expense in the above computation is interest expense related to the cardmember lending activities, international banking operations, and charge card and other activities in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest expense does not include
interest on liabilities recorded under GAAP governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Companys policy is to classify such interest in income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
For purposes of the earnings computation, other adjustments include adding the amortization of capitalized interest,
the net loss of affiliates accounted for under the equity method whose debt is not guaranteed by the Company, the minority interest in the earnings of majority-owned subsidiaries with fixed charges, and the interest component of rental expense, and
subtracting undistributed net income of affiliates accounted for under the equity method. 
For purposes of the fixed
charges computation, other adjustments include capitalized interest costs and the interest component of rental expense.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
The
financial section of American Express Companys (the Company) Annual Report consists of this Financial Review, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion is designed to
provide perspective and understanding regarding the Companys consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Certain key terms are defined in the Glossary of Selected Terminology, which begins on page 61. 
This Financial Review and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless
otherwise noted. 
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
American Express is a global service company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. The Companys principal products
and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. The Companys range of products and services include: 
charge and credit card products; 
expense management products and services; 
consumer and business travel services; 
stored value products such as Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products; 
network services for the Companys network partners; 
merchant acquisition and processing, point-of-sale, servicing and settlement and marketing products and services for merchants; and

fee services, including market and trend analyses along with related consulting services and customer loyalty and rewards programs.

The Companys products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small
businesses, middle-market companies, and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels including direct mail, on-line applications, targeted direct and third-party sales forces, and direct response advertising.

The Companys products and services generate the following types of revenue for the Company: 
Discount revenue, which is the Companys largest revenue source, represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase
goods and services on the Companys network; 
Net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual charge card memberships; 
Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee for airline or other travel-related transactions;

Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments; 
Securitization income, net, which is the net earnings related to cardmember loans financed through securitization activities;

Other revenue, which represents insurance premiums earned from cardmember travel and other insurance programs, revenues arising from contracts with
Global Network Services (GNS) partners (including royalties and signing fees), publishing revenues, and other miscellaneous revenue and fees; and 
Interest and fees on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances, and card fees related to the cardmember
lending portfolio. 
In addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue, other major expense
categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new cardmembers and promote cardmember loyalty and spending, and provisions for anticipated cardmember credit and fraud losses. 
In 2009, to better position the Company to grow its traditional businesses, and to develop new revenue categories and emerging payments, the
Company implemented the following organizational changes: 
Grouped the Companys global consumer and small business card-issuing, merchant and network businesses under the senior leadership of the Vice
Chairman of American Express, which will enable the Company to sharpen its focus on its strongest growth opportunities, while maintaining appropriate confidentiality protections; 
The Company is creating the Enterprise Growth Group, which will focus exclusively on generating new sources of fee revenue from existing assets and
advancing the Companys efforts in emerging payments; 
Formed a new Global Services Group under the leadership of the Companys Group President and Chief Information Officer, which unites the
Companys U.S. and international cardmember servicing organizations, as well as most processing and support functions across the Company including, among others, technology support and certain key processing functions in areas such as finance
and human resources. With this change to Global Services, the Company is organizing support functions by process rather than business unit, which the Company expects will streamline costs, reduce duplication of work, better integrate skills and
expertise, and improve customer

service. The expenses that now fall within Global Services account for just under half of the Companys consolidated operating expense. This organization has been tasked with generating an
annualized level of gross expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2012. It is expected that a portion of any such savings would be reinvested in growth initiatives; and 
Also, as part of the organizational changes, the Companys Chief Executive Officer is now working directly with the leaders of the Global
Commercial Card and Global Travel Services groups on overall strategies to capitalize on Business-to-Business growth opportunities. 
Historically, the Company has sought to achieve a number of financial targets, on average and over time: 
Revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 percent; 
Earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12 to 15 percent; and 
Return on average equity (ROE) of 33 to 36 percent. 
In addition, assuming achievement of such financial targets, the Company has sought to return at least 65 percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of
common stock. 
The Company met or exceeded these targets for most of the past decade. However, during 2008 and 2009, its
performance fell short of the targets due to the effects of the continuing global economic downturn. As long as these difficult conditions persist, it is unlikely that the Company will achieve all of its on average and over time financial
objectives. The Companys share repurchase program was suspended in 2008 and, as a result, the amount of capital generated that is returned to shareholders has been and will likely continue to be below the levels achieved earlier in the decade.

The Company believes it will be positioned, over the long term, to generate revenue and earnings growth in line with its
historical target levels. However, evolving market, regulatory and rating agency expectations will likely cause the Company, as well as other financial institutions, to maintain in future years a higher level of capital than they would have
historically maintained. These higher capital requirements would in turn lead, all other things being equal, to lower future ROE than the Company has historically targeted. While the Company is not establishing a new target at this time, it
currently believes that it will ultimately be positioned to deliver a ROE in excess of 20 percent over time. As the capital requirements for financial institutions become clearer, management will have greater visibility into this area. At that time,
the Company will provide updated long-term ROE and capital distribution targets. 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company became a bank
holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) became the Companys primary federal regulator. As such, the Company is subject to the Federal Reserves regulations, policies and
minimum capital standards. 
CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT/OUTLOOK 
2009 was a challenging year characterized by a weak economy, frozen credit markets in the first half of the year and high credit losses industry wide. In the first two quarters, the Companys
spending and cardmember loan balances declined by double digits as compared to the corresponding periods in 2008 and credit metrics (e.g. past due and write-off rates) peaked at historically high levels. In the third quarter, the Companys
credit actions began to positively impact past due and write-off rates, and spending declines began to become less severe. The fourth quarter showed greater improvement. 
In the fourth quarter of 2009 the year-over-year growth rate in cardmember spending volumes was positive for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, benefiting from both easier comparisons to
year-ago billings as well as higher levels of spending. Improvements in billed business trends were experienced in all business lines in the fourth quarter. In addition, for the first time during the year, the growth rate in both the number of card
transactions and average transaction size were positive in the fourth quarter as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Despite these favorable trends, the Company expects the global economy to continue to recover gradually and the resulting
environment to be characterized by billings growth that is more modest than it experienced before the recession, as consumers and businesses remain cautious about their spending. 
The favorable credit trends experienced in the third quarter of 2009 continued to show overall improvement in the fourth quarter. Charge card
write-off rates and past-due trends in the United States continued to improve significantly during the fourth quarter, reaching historic lows by the end of the year and contributing to lower provision levels. Worldwide lending write-off rates also
continued to decline in the fourth quarter, improving for the second quarter in a row. This was driven in part by a broad range of credit and business actions, such as enhanced credit and collection policies and practices. Lending past-due trends
also continued to improve in the fourth quarter. If past-due trends, recoveries and bankruptcies remain stable, the Company expects managed U.S. lending write-offs in the first quarter of 2010 to be similar to those in the fourth quarter of 2009,
and

further expects these write-offs in the second quarter of 2010 to be lower than the first quarter.
1
In 2010, the Company intends to invest a substantial portion of expected benefits from its improving credit performance. The Company will focus on launching new products and services, improving long-term margins with investments in
infrastructure, and driving growth for the moderate to long-term. As the Company continues to scale back its issuance of proprietary lending cards and targets more premium cards, the Companys priority will be to drive billed business and
average spend per card rather than achieve broad growth in cards-in-force. 
The Companys net interest yield in 2009 was
impacted by re-pricing actions, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act), and changing consumer behavior. Going forward, these same dynamics will apply, with more impact from the CARD Act expected in the future. As
such, the Company expects net interest yields to trend down closer to historic levels over time. 
The Company expects its 2010
EPS growth to be well above its long-term EPS target of 12 percent to 15 percent. 
REENGINEERING INITIATIVES 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company announced various reengineering initiatives which were expected to produce cost benefits of approximately $1.8
billion in 2009 versus the previously anticipated spending levels. These initiatives included: reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses (expected benefits of $700 million in 2009), reducing certain operating costs (expected benefit of $125
million in 2009) and scaling back investment spending (expected benefit of $1.0 billion in 2009). The Company began the execution and implementation of these initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2008, and as such, recorded a fourth quarter of 2008
restructuring charge of $404 million ($262 million after-tax) in continuing operations, primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 7,000 positions, in addition to $17 million ($11 million
after-tax) of other net reengineering costs. 
In the second quarter of 2009, the Company announced another phase of
reengineering initiatives which were

The managed basis presentation includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the
owned basis (GAAP) information and the managed basis information is attributable to the effects of securitized activities. The Company is not presenting estimates of owned net write-off rates comparable to the managed data
above because the owned net write-off rates are not determinable at this time. For further discussion of the Companys owned and managed basis presentation, refer to the information set forth under U.S. Card Services in the section captioned
Differences Between GAAP and Managed Presentations. 

expected to produce incremental cost benefits of approximately $800 million in 2009. These initiatives included: reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses (expected benefit of $175
million in 2009), scaling back investment spending on marketing and business development (expected benefit of $500 million in 2009) and cutting certain professional services, travel and general overhead expenses (expected benefit of $125 million in
2009). The Company began the implementation of these initiatives in the second quarter of 2009, and as such, recorded a second quarter 2009 net reengineering charge of $182 million ($118 million after-tax) in continuing operations, primarily
associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 4,000 positions. Cumulatively, through these reengineering initiatives, the Company expected to eliminate approximately 11,000 positions, which accounted for
approximately 17 percent of its global workforce as of September 30, 2008. 
As the Company has previously indicated,
business results in the second half of 2009 have been stronger than initially forecasted primarily due to favorable credit and business trends. The benefits from these favorable trends have been utilized to increase spending on marketing and other
business-building initiatives during the latter part of 2009. These increased investments have in turn reduced the targeted savings from our reengineering initiatives of approximately $2.6 billion described above. These favorable trends also drove
other business changes and modifications to previously planned reengineering initiatives which have resulted in a lower level of employee staff reductions and higher employee redeployment to other positions in the Company, further reducing targeted
savings. As of December 31, 2009, employee count has declined 8,200 or 12 percent since September 30, 2008 primarily due to the above initiatives. 
ACQUISITIONS 
On January 15, 2010, the Company purchased Revolution Money, a
provider of secure person-to-person payment services through an internet based platform, for approximately $300 million. Revolution Money offers online person-to-person payment accounts that are FDIC insured and suited for social and instant
messaging networks and offers the RevolutionCard, a general-use PIN-based card with enhanced security. The Company believes that Revolution Moneys assets and expertise complement both its existing payments and processing capabilities, and also
provides it with an innovative technology platform which can help extend the Companys leadership beyond the traditional payments arena. 
On March 28, 2008, the Company purchased Corporate Payment Services (CPS), General Electric Companys commercial card and corporate purchasing business unit. The Company acquired $2.2 billion in
assets and assumed $63 million in liabilities. The total cash consideration of $2.3

billion paid by the Company consisted of the contractual purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion plus the repayment of CPS $1.2 billion in outstanding debt as of the acquisition date.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
For the applicable periods, the operating results, assets and liabilities, and cash flows of American Express Bank Ltd. (AEB), which was sold to Standard Chartered PLC (Standard Chartered) in 2008, and American Express International Deposit
Company (AEIDC), which was sold to Standard Chartered in the third quarter of 2009, have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and reported separately within the discontinued operations captions on the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements. 
Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys
discontinued operations.

(a)
Earnings per common share from continuing operations  diluted and Earnings per common share  diluted were both reduced by the impact of (i) accelerated
preferred dividend accretion of $212 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the repurchase of $3.39 billion of preferred shares issued as part of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), (ii) preferred share dividends and related
accretion of $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and (iii) earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of $22 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

(b)
Effective January 1, 2009, guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities requires that
restricted stock awards be included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Accordingly, the Company has retrospectively adjusted EPS for all prior periods presented. Refer to Note 18 to the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 
(c)
ROE is calculated by dividing (i) net income ($2.1 billion and $2.7 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively), by (ii) average total shareholders equity
($14.6 billion and $12.1 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively). 
(d)
Return on average tangible common equity is computed in the same manner as ROE except the computation of average tangible common shareholders equity (TCE)
excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of profitability of its
business. 
See Consolidated Results of Operations, beginning on page 31, for discussion of the Companys results.

The Company follows U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition to information provided on a GAAP basis,
the Company discloses certain data on a managed basis. This information, which should be read only as a supplement to GAAP information, assumes, in the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information and U.S. Card Services (USCS) segment,
there have been no cardmember loans securitization transactions. These managed basis adjustments, and managements rationale for such presentation, are discussed further in the USCS section below under Differences between GAAP and Managed
Basis Presentation. 
Certain of the statements in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this discussion.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies referenced, as applicable, to
other notes. The following chart provides information about five critical accounting policies that are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that require significant management assumptions and judgments. 
RESERVES FOR CARDMEMBER LOSSES 
Description
Assumptions/Approach Used
Effect if Actual Results
Differ
from Assumptions
Reserves for cardmember losses relating to cardmember loans and receivables represent managements best estimate of the losses inherent
in the Companys outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables.
Reserves for cardmember loans and receivables losses are primarily based upon models that
analyze portfolio performance and reflect managements judgment regarding overall reserve adequacy. The analytic models take into account several factors, including average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. Management
considers whether to adjust the analytic models for specific factors such as increased risk in certain portfolios, impact of risk management initiatives on portfolio performance and concentration of credit risk based on factors such as tenure,
industry or geographic regions. In addition, management adjusts the reserves for losses for other external environmental factors including leading economic and market indicators such as the unemployment rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), home price
indices, non-farm payrolls, personal consumption expenditures index, consumer confidence index, purchasing managers index, bankruptcy filings, and the legal and regulatory environment. Generally, due to the short-term nature of cardmember
receivables, the impact of the other external environmental factors on the inherent losses within the cardmember receivable portfolio is not significant. As part of this evaluation process, management also considers various reserve coverage metrics,
such as reserves as a percentage of past-due amounts, reserves as a percentage of cardmember loans and receivables, and net write-off coverage.
Cardmember loans and receivables are written off when management deems amounts to be uncollectible and is generally determined by the number of days past due. Cardmember loans and USCS cardmember
receivables are generally written off when
(continued on next page)
To the extent historical credit experience updated for emerging market trends in credit are not
indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from managements judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for losses, as applicable.
As of December 31, 2009, an increase in write-offs equivalent to 20 basis points of cardmember loan and receivable balances at such date
would increase the provision for cardmember losses by approximately $133 million. This sensitivity analysis does not represent managements expectations of the deterioration in write-offs but is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the
sensitivity of the provision for cardmember losses to changes in key inputs.
The process of determining the reserve for
cardmember losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions.

RESERVES FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS COSTS 
Description
Assumptions/Approach Used
Effect if Actual Results
Differ
from Assumptions
The Membership Rewards program is the largest card-based rewards program in the industry.
Eligible cardmembers can earn points for purchases charged and many of the Companys card products offer the ability to earn bonus points for certain types of purchases. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards
including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise.
Points typically do not expire and there is no limit
on the number of points a cardmember may earn. A large majority of spending by eligible cardmembers earns points under the program. While cardmember spend, redemption rates, and the related expense have increased, the Company believes it has
historically benefited through higher revenues, lower cardmember attrition and credit losses and more timely payments.
The
Company establishes balance sheet reserves that represent the estimated future cost of points earned to date that are ultimately expected to be redeemed. These reserves reflect managements judgment regarding overall adequacy. The provision for
the cost of Membership Rewards is included in marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses.
A weighted-average cost per point redeemed during the previous 12 months, adjusted as
appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, is used to approximate future redemption costs and is affected by the mix of rewards redeemed. Management uses models to estimate ultimate redemption rates based on historical redemption
statistics, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels. These models incorporate sophisticated statistical and actuarial techniques to estimate ultimate redemption rates of points earned to date by
current cardmembers given redemption trends and projected future redemption behavior.
The global ultimate redemption rate
assumption for current participants is approximately 90 percent. The Company continually evaluates its reserve methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, contract changes, and other factors.

The reserve for the estimated cost of points expected to be redeemed is impacted over time by
enrollment levels, the number of points earned and redeemed, and the weighted-average cost per point, which is influenced by redemption choices made by cardmembers, reward offerings by partners and other Membership Rewards program changes. The
reserve is most sensitive to changes in the estimated ultimate redemption rate. This rate is based on the expectation that a large majority of all points earned will eventually be redeemed.
As of December 31, 2009, if the ultimate redemption rate of current enrollees increased by 100 basis points, the balance sheet reserve
and corresponding provision for the cost of Membership Rewards would each increase by approximately $250 million.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
Description
Assumptions/Approach Used
Effect if Actual Results
Differ
from Assumptions
The Company holds investment securities, certain subordinated interests in securitized
cardmember loans from the Companys securitization program and derivative instruments. These financial instruments are reflected at fair value on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management makes significant assumptions and
judgments when estimating fair value for these financial instruments.
Investment Securities
The Companys investment securities are comprised of predominantly fixed-income securities issued by
states and municipalities as well as the U.S. Government and Agencies (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae) and retained subordinated securities described further below. The investment securities are classified as available-for-sale with
changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within shareholders equity on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets (except for approximately $213 million, as of December 31, 2008, of investment
securities included in discontinued operations, for which changes in fair value are recorded in (loss) income from discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income).
Securitized Cardmember Loans
When the Company securitizes cardmember loans, they are accounted for as sales and the loans are removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company retains certain subordinated interests in the securitized cardmember loans, which may include one or more investments in tranches of the securitization (retained subordinated securities) and an interest-only strip.
In accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance, the objective of a fair value
measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The disclosure guidance establishes a
three-level hierarchy of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1), followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2), with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3).
Investment Securities
The fair market values for the Companys investment securities (excluding its retained subordinated securities, which are discussed further below) are
obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by the Company. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated by using pricing models where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs. The inputs to the
valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and/or broker-dealer quotes,
all with reasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services do not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, the Company did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. The Company has reaffirmed
its understanding of the valuation techniques used by its pricing services. In addition, the Company corroborates the prices provided by its pricing services to test their reasonableness by comparing their prices to valuations
(continued on next page)
Investment Securities
In the measurement of fair value for the Companys investment securities (excluding its retained subordinated securities, which are discussed further below), even though the underlying inputs used in
the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs
are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.
Retained
Subordinated Securities and Interest-Only Strip
In measuring the fair value for the Companys retained subordinated securities, the
fair value is impacted by external market factors including London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) forward rates and credit spreads, and therefore, the use of different inputs to the measurement of the fair value of the Companys retained
subordinated securities could result in a different fair value measurement.
The fair value of the interest-only strip is
impacted by changes in the estimates and assumptions used in the valuation models. The use of different inputs to the measurement of fair value of these financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.
Refer to Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, including sensitivity analyses relating to changes in key
assumptions for the retained subordinated securities and interest-only strip.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (CONTINUED) 
Description
Assumptions/Approach Used
Effect if Actual Results
Differ
from Assumptions
Retained Subordinated Securities
Accounting for the retained subordinated securities aligns with that described under investment securities above.
Interest-Only Strip
The interest-only strip is reported at fair value in other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip are also recorded in
securitization income, net in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
Due to changes in GAAP governing the
accounting for transfers of financial assets, effective January 1, 2010, the Companys retained subordinated securities and interest-only strip will be eliminated in consolidation and no longer measured at fair value.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets
Defined benefit pension plan (the Plan) assets are measured at fair value, changes in which are included in the determination of the Plans net funded
status which is reported in other liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold
securities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of the Companys investment securities are classified in either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Retained Subordinated Securities and Interest-Only
Strip
The fair value of the Companys retained subordinated securities and interest-only strip are determined using discounted cash
flow models.
The discount rate for the retained subordinated securities is estimated based on an interest rate curve that
is observable in the marketplace plus an unobservable credit spread commensurate with the risk of the securities and similar financial instruments.
The fair value of the Companys interest-only strip is the present value of estimated future positive excess spread expected to be generated by the securitized loans over the estimated remaining life
of those loans. Management utilizes certain estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the interest-only strip asset including estimates for finance charge yield, credit losses, LIBOR (which determines future certificate interest
costs), monthly payment rate and the discount rate.
The Companys retained subordinated securities and interest-only
strip are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
Realized
losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in value is other-than-temporary, which requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews and evaluates its investment securities, including retained
subordinated securities at least quarterly, and more often as market conditions may require, to

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
In determining whether any of the Companys investment securities (including retained subordinated securities) are other-than-temporarily impaired, a
change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment around the Companys view on collectability and credit quality of the issuer, or the Companys intent to sell the investment securities, and whether it is more
likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses. Therefore, it is at least reasonably possible that a change in estimate will occur in the near term relating to
other-than-temporary impairment. This could result in the Company recording an other-than-temporary impairment loss through earnings with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
Company had approximately $0.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in gross unrealized losses in its investment securities portfolio (including its retained subordinated securities) which were deemed not to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets
The fair value measurements for the Plan assets contain a similar amount of subjectivity as described under investment securities above, and therefore
differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

Derivative Instruments
The Companys primary derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward agreements, and cross-currency swaps. Derivative instruments are reported at fair value in other
assets and other liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, and/or in the Consolidated Statements of Income, depending on (i) the
documentation and designation of the derivative instrument, and (ii) if the derivative instrument is in a hedging relationship, its effectiveness in offsetting the changes in the designated risk being hedged.
identify investment securities that have indications of other-than-temporary impairment. The
determination of other-than-temporary impairment is a subjective process, requiring the use of judgments and assumptions. Accordingly, the Company considers several metrics when evaluating investment securities for an other-than-temporary
impairment. The key factors considered when assessing other-than-temporary impairment include the determination of the extent to which the decline in fair value of the investment security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer, or
market interest rate risk. With respect to increased default risk, the Company assesses the collectibility of principal and interest payments by monitoring a number of issuer specific factors, and the extent to which amortized cost exceeds fair
value and the duration and size of that difference. With respect to market interest rate risk, including benchmark interest rates and credit spreads, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the investment securities, and whether it is
more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses. Refer to Note 6 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets
The fair value measurements for the Plan assets align with those described under investment securities above. Refer to Note 21 to the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Derivative
Instruments
The fair value of the Companys derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that
uses proprietary pricing models, or by using internal pricing models, neither of which contains a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do not require significant judgment and inputs to those
(continued on next page)
Derivative Instruments
In the measurement of fair value for the Companys derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets, the pricing
models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore, differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value. In addition, any necessary credit valuation adjustments are based on
observable default rates. A change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about counterparty credit quality, which could result in the Company recognizing an additional counterparty credit valuation adjustment. As
of December 31, 2009, the credit and nonperformance risks associated with the Companys derivative instrument counterparties were not significant.

models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. In each case, the valuation models
used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period of maturity, and market-based parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or prices, and volatility.
Credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters (for example, a benchmark curve) used to value the derivative
instruments are not indicative of the credit quality of the Company or its counterparties. The Company considers the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure.
The Company manages derivative instrument counterparty credit risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of
contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential value of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative instrument credit
risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment grade. The Companys derivative instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Notes 3 and 12 to the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements.

GOODWILL 
Description
Assumptions/Approach Used
Effect if Actual Results
Differ
from Assumptions
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually at June 30 and between annual tests if events or circumstances arise, such as
adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value.
The Company assigns goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as either an operating segment, or a business one level below an operating segment
for which discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews.
The goodwill impairment test
utilizes a two-step approach. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
Goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the
carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earnings multiples or transaction multiples for the industry in which the reporting unit operates) or
the income approach (discounted cash flow methods). The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach.
When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company estimates future cash flows using the reporting
units internal five year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in view of current and expected future economic conditions. The Company then applies a discount rate to discount
these future cash flows to arrive at a net present value amount, which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The discount rate applied approximates the expected cost of equity financing, determined using a capital asset pricing
model. The model generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in an investment. The Company believes the
resulting rate, 11.4 percent, appropriately reflects the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and in the Companys internally developed forecasts.
The Company has approximately $2.3 billion of goodwill as of December 31, 2009. The fair value of each of the Companys reporting units
is above its carrying value; accordingly, the Company has concluded its goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2009. The Company could be exposed to increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions
differ significantly from managements current assumptions.

INCOME TAXES 
Description
Assumptions/Approach Used
Effect if Actual Results
Differ
from Assumptions
The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and
municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for
income tax expense, the Company must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The Company establishes a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.
Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority
and also in determining the ultimate amount that is likely to be realized. A tax position is recognized only when, based on managements judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained upon examination. The amount of tax benefit recognized is based on the Companys assessment of the most likely outcome on ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. This measurement is based on many factors, including
whether a tax dispute may be settled through negotiation with the taxing authority or is only subject to review in the courts. As new information becomes available, the Company evaluates its tax positions, and adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits,
as appropriate.
Deferred Taxes
Since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the financial statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to
determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary
differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
If the tax benefit ultimately realized differs from the amount previously recognized in the income tax provision, the Company recognizes an adjustment of the unrecognized tax benefit through the income
tax provision.
Deferred Taxes
Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, the Company records or
adjusts the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts or circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease to the income tax provision.

(c)
Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the
primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic
cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements. 
(d)
This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and GNS) retained by the Company from
merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. 
(e)
Average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees,
including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs, plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans (including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs), divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force.
The card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $186 million, $146 million and $130 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The adjusted average fee per card is computed
in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs (a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans). The
amount of amortization excluded was $243 million, $320 million and $288 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes that this metric
presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
(a)
See Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information. 
(b)
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in USCS are written off to 180 days past due,
consistent with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past billing. The net write-offs for 2008 include approximately $341 million resulting from this write-off methodology change, which is not
reflected in the net write-off rate for USCS. If the $341 million had been included in USCS write-offs, the net write-off rate would have been 5.4 percent for 2008. 
(c)
A cardmember account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the cardmembers billing statement date. In addition, if
the Company initiates collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated cardmember receivable balance is considered as 90 days past billing. A cardmember account becomes past due if payment is not
received within 30 days after the billing statement date. 
(d)
Owned, a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
(e)
This amount includes reserves of $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, that were removed in connection with securitizations during the period. The
offset is in the allocated cost of the associated retained subordinated securities. This amount also includes foreign currency translation adjustments. The prior period included foreign currency translation and other adjustments primarily related to
the reclassification of certain waived fee reserves to a contra-cardmember receivable. 
(f)
See below for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans and the ratio of net interest income divided by average loans presented on an owned basis. The
Company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans (on both an owned and managed basis) is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio. 
(g)
Includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the owned basis (GAAP) information and
managed basis information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. Refer to the information set forth under USCS Selected Financial Information for further discussion of the managed basis presentation.

This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not

attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 
The Companys 2009 consolidated income from continuing operations decreased $734 million or
26 percent to $2.1 billion and diluted EPS from continuing operations declined $0.93 or 38 percent to $1.54. Consolidated income from continuing operations for 2008 decreased $1.3 billion or 30 percent from 2007 and diluted EPS from continuing
operations for 2008 declined $0.97 or 28 percent from 2007. 
The Companys 2009 consolidated net income decreased $569
million or 21 percent to $2.1 billion, and diluted EPS decreased $0.78 or 34 percent to $1.54. Consolidated net income for 2008 and 2007 was $2.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Net income included losses from discontinued operations of $7
million, $172 million and $114 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
The Companys total revenues net of
interest expense, provisions for losses, and total expenses decreased by approximately 14 percent, 8 percent and 14 percent, respectively, in 2009. Assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2008 to 2009, total revenues net of
interest expense, provisions for losses and total expenses decreased approximately 12 percent, 7 percent and 12

percent, respectively, in 2009.

 Currency rate changes had a minimal impact on the growth rates in 2008. 
Results from continuing
operations for 2009 included: 
A $180 million ($113 million after-tax) benefit in the third quarter related to the accounting for a net investment in the Companys consolidated
foreign subsidiaries. See also Business Segment Results  Corporate & Other below for further discussion; 
A $211 million ($135 million after-tax) gain in the second quarter of 2009 on the sale of 50 percent of the Companys equity holdings of
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC); and 
A $190 million ($125 million after-tax) net charge related to the Companys reengineering initiatives. 
Results from continuing operations for 2008 included: 
A $600 million ($374 million after-tax) addition to U.S. lending credit reserves reflecting a deterioration of credit indicators in the second quarter
of 2008; 
A $449 million ($291 million after-tax) net charge, primarily reflecting the restructuring costs related to the Companys reengineering
initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2008; 
A $220 million ($138 million after-tax) reduction to the fair market value of the Companys interest-only strip; and 
A $106 million ($66 million after-tax) charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 to increase the Companys Membership Rewards liability, in connection
with the Companys extension of its partnership arrangements with Delta. 
Results from continuing operations for
2007 included: 
A $1.13 billion ($700 million after-tax) gain for the initial payment due March 31, 2008, from Visa as part of the litigation settlement;

An $80 million ($50 million after-tax) gain in connection with derivative and hedging instruments; 
A $63 million ($39 million after-tax) gain relating to amendments to the Companys U.S. pension plans, effective July 1, 2007, that reduced
projected pension obligations to plan participants;

These currency rate adjustments assume a constant exchange rate between periods for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign
exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year-earlier period against which such results are being compared). Management believes that this presentation is helpful to investors by making it easier to
compare the Companys performance from one period to another without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
A $685 million ($430 million after-tax) charge related to enhancements to the method of estimating Membership Rewards liability;

A $438 million ($274 million after-tax) credit-related charge due to experienced deterioration of credit indicators in the latter part of 2007. This
fourth quarter charge was split between USCS cardmember loans and cardmember receivables of $288 million and $96 million, respectively, and included $54 million relating to a reduction in the fair value of the Companys retained subordinated
interest in securitized cardmember loans; 
$211 million ($131 million after-tax) of incremental business-building costs; 
$74 million ($46 million after-tax) of Visa litigation-related costs; and 
A $50 million ($31 million after-tax) contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund. 
Also included in the 2007 results were $66 million ($43 million after-tax) of reengineering costs related to the Companys business travel, prepaid
services, international payments business and technology areas. 
Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 
Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense for 2009 of $24.5 billion were down $3.8 billion or 14 percent from 2008, due to lower discount revenue,
lower total interest income, reduced securitization income, net, lower other commissions and fees, reduced travel commissions and fees, and decreased other revenues, partially offset by lower total interest expense. Consolidated total revenues net
of interest expense of $28.4 billion for 2008 were $806 million or 3 percent higher than 2007 primarily due to greater discount revenue, lower total interest expense, higher other revenues, increased net card fees and greater travel commissions and
fees, partially offset by lower securitization income, net, decreased interest income and lower other commissions and fees. 
Discount revenue for 2009 declined $1.6 billion or 11 percent as compared to 2008 to $13.4 billion as a result of a 9 percent decrease in worldwide billed business. The greater decrease in discount revenue compared to billed business
primarily reflects growth in billed business related to GNS where the Company shares the discount revenue with card issuing partners, as well as a slight decline in the average discount rate. The 9 percent decrease in worldwide billed business in
2009 reflected decline in proprietary billed business of 11 percent, offset by a 7 percent increase in billed business related to GNS. The average discount rate was 2.54 percent, 2.55 percent, and 2.56 percent for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
Over time, selective repricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business, and volume-related pricing discounts likely will result in some erosion of the average discount rate.

U.S. billed business and billed business outside the United States were down 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in 2009. The decline in
billed business within the United States reflected a decrease in basic cards-in-force and average spending per proprietary basic card. The decline in billed business outside the United States reflected a decrease in average spending per proprietary
basic card and decreases within the Companys consumer card, small business and Corporate Services business.

Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, total billed business outside the United
States reflected mid-single digit volume increases in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and mid-single digit declines in Canada and Europe. 
During 2008, discount revenue rose $429 million or 3 percent to $15 billion compared to 2007 as a result of a 6 percent increase in worldwide billed business, partially offset by a lower average discount
rate, relatively faster growth in billed business related to GNS, and higher cash-back rewards costs and corporate incentive payments, which are reported as reductions to revenue (contra-revenue). The 6 percent increase in worldwide billed business
in 2008 reflected growth in proprietary billed business of 4 percent, and a 27 percent increase in billed business related to GNS. 
Net card fees in 2009 remained unchanged compared to 2008 as the decline in total proprietary cards in force was offset by an increase in the average fee per card. Net card fees in 2008 of $2.2 billion increased $231 million or 12 percent
compared to 2007 due to higher average fee per proprietary card. 
Travel commissions and fees decreased $416 million or 21
percent to $1.6 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a 28 percent decrease in worldwide travel sales, partially offset by higher sales commission and fee rates.

Table of Contents
2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

Travel commissions and fees in 2008 of $2.0 billion increased $84 million or 4 percent compared to 2007, primarily reflecting a 3 percent increase in worldwide travel sales. 
Other commissions and fees decreased $529 million or 23 percent to $1.8 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, due to lower delinquency fees
reflecting decreased owned loan balances and the impacts of various customer assistance programs, in addition to reduced spending-related foreign currency conversion revenues. Other commissions and fees decreased $110 million or 5 percent in 2008 to
$2.3 billion compared to 2007 due to the reclassification to other revenues in USCS of certain card service-related fees beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and a lower level of fees related to a lower average balance of owned loans, which were
partially offset by increased assessment revenues. 
Securitization income, net decreased $670 million or 63 percent to $400
million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs and a decrease in interest income on cardmember loans and fee revenues. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in
interest expense due to lower coupon rates paid on variable-rate investor certificates, as well as a favorable fair value adjustment of the interest-only strip. Securitization income, net decreased $437 million or 29 percent to $1.1 billion in 2008
compared to 2007, primarily due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs, charges to the fair value of the interest-only strip reflecting lower expected future cash flows, and a net loss on sales compared to net gains in the prior
year. These impacts were partially offset by higher finance charges and fees due to a greater average balance of securitized loans and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on investor certificates. 
Other revenues in 2009 decreased $70 million or 3 percent to $2.1 billion compared to 2008, primarily reflecting decreased revenues from CPS,
due to the migration of clients to the American Express network, and lower publishing revenues, partially offset by the ICBC gain. Other revenues increased $406 million or 23 percent to $2.2 billion in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily reflecting the
benefits of the CPS acquisition, higher network and partner-related revenues, a reclassification from other commissions and fees from USCS as discussed above, and greater foreign exchange-related revenues. 
Interest income decreased $1.9 billion or 26 percent to $5.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and fees on loans decreased $1.7
billion or 27 percent due to decline in the average owned loan balance, reduced market interest rates and the impact of various customer assistance programs, partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives. Interest and dividends on
investment securities increased $33 million or 4 percent, primarily reflecting increased investment levels partially offset by reduced investment yields. Interest income from deposits with banks and other decreased $212 million or 78 percent,
primarily due to a reduced yield and a lower balance of deposits in other banks. During 2008, interest income decreased $223 million or 3 percent to $7.2 billion compared to 2007, reflecting primarily a decrease in interest and fees on loans, which
declined $192 million or 3 percent due to a lower portfolio yield, reduced market interest rates on variably priced assets, partially offset by a slightly higher average owned loan balance. 
Interest expense decreased $1.3 billion or 38 percent to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest expense related to deposits
decreased $29 million or 6 percent, primarily due to a lower cost of funds which more than offset increased balances. Interest expense related to short-term borrowings decreased $446 million or 92 percent, due to significantly lower short-term debt
levels and a lower cost of funds. Interest expense related to long-term debt and other decreased $873 million or 33 percent, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds driven by reduced market rates on variably priced debt, as well as a lower
average balance of long-term debt outstanding. Interest expense of $3.6 billion in 2008 was $426 million or 11 percent lower than 2007 reflecting a $248 million decrease in interest expense on short-term borrowing, primarily due to a lower cost of
funds and a decrease in average short-term debt. 
Provisions for Losses 
Provisions for losses of $5.3 billion in 2009 decreased $485 million or 8 percent compared to 2008. Charge card provisions for losses decreased $506 million,
or 37 percent, primarily driven by improved credit performance. Cardmember loans provisions for losses increased $35 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to a higher cardmember reserve level due to the challenging credit environment, partially
offset by a lower owned loan balance. 
Provisions for losses of $5.8 billion in 2008 increased $1.7 billion or 41 percent
compared to 2007. Charge card provisions for losses increased $223 million or 20 percent in 2008 primarily due to higher loss and delinquency rates compared to 2007, partially offset by the credit-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Cardmember loans provisions for losses increased $1.5 billion or 53 percent due to higher write-off and delinquency rates and higher average owned loan balances. 
Expenses 
Consolidated expenses for 2009 were $16.4 billion, down $2.6 billion or
14 percent from $19.0 billion in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by lower other, net expenses, reduced salaries and employee benefits expenses, lower marketing and promotion expense and decreased cardmember rewards expense partially
offset by greater cardmember services expense. Consolidated expenses for 2008 were $19.0 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7 percent from $17.8 billion in 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily driven by higher other, net expenses, greater salaries and
employee

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

benefits expenses, higher occupancy and equipment expenses, increased professional services costs and greater cardmember services expense, partially offset by decreased cardmember rewards expense
and lower marketing and promotion expense. Consolidated expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007 also included $190 million, $449 million and $66 million, respectively, of reengineering costs, of which $185 million, $417 million, and $49 million,
respectively, represent restructuring charges. Refer to the discussion earlier regarding the Companys 2008 and 2009 reengineering initiatives and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for restructuring activities for all periods.

Marketing and promotion expenses decreased $516 million or 21 percent to $1.9 billion in 2009 from $2.4 billion in 2008, due
to lower spending levels in the first three quarters of 2009, partially offset by higher expense in the fourth quarter of 2009. Marketing and promotion for 2008 decreased $132 million or 5 percent to $2.4 billion, reflecting decreased investments as
compared to 2007, which included the incremental business-building costs. 
Cardmember rewards expenses decreased $353 million
or 8 percent to $4.0 billion in 2009 from $4.4 billion in 2008, reflecting lower rewards-related spending volumes, partially offset by higher redemption rates and costs in Membership Rewards and higher costs with relatively lower declines in
co-brand spending volumes. Cardmember rewards decreased $388 million or 8 percent to $4.4 billion in 2008 from $4.8 billion in 2007, reflecting the Membership Rewards-related charge in 2007, which was partially offset by the Delta-related charge in
2008 to increase the Membership Rewards liability and higher volume-driven rewards costs. 
Salaries and employee benefits
expenses decreased $1.0 billion or 17 percent to $5.1 billion in 2009 from $6.1 billion in 2008, reflecting lower employee levels and costs related to the Companys reengineering initiatives, as well as the restructuring charge in the fourth
quarter of 2008. Salaries and employee benefits expenses in 2008 increased $652 million or 12 percent to $6.1 billion from $5.4 billion in 2007 reflecting the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charge related to the Companys reengineering
initiatives, an increase in average headcount, greater merit and sales force-related incentive costs and the pension-related gain in 2007. 
Professional services expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 remained flat. Professional services expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 increased $133 million or 6 percent. 
Other, net expenses in 2009 decreased $708 million or 23 percent to $2.4 billion compared to 2008, reflecting the full year of settlement
payments from MasterCard in 2009 versus two quarters in 2008, a $180 million third quarter benefit related to the accounting for a net investment in the Companys consolidated foreign subsidiaries (as discussed further in Business Segment
Results  Corporate & Other below), a $59 million benefit in the second quarter of 2009 from the completion of certain account reconciliations related to prior periods, and lower travel and entertainment and other expenses due to
the Companys reengineering activities. These were partially offset by a $9 million favorable impact in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to fair value hedge ineffectiveness. Other, net expenses in 2008 increased $895 million or 40 percent to
$3.1 billion compared to 2007 primarily due to the initial $1.13 billion Visa litigation settlement gain in the fourth quarter of 2007, net of litigation expenses, the related contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund and the 2008
expenses related to the CPS acquisition. These impacts were partially offset by the 2008 settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa. 
Income Taxes 
The effective tax rate was 25 percent in 2009 compared to 20 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2007. The tax
rates for these years reflect tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years tax items and recurring permanent tax benefits in relation to the level of pretax income. 
Discontinued Operations 
Loss from
discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7 million, $172 million and $114 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, primarily reflected AEIDC and AEB results from operations, including
AEIDCs $15 million ($10 million after-tax), $275 million ($179 million after-tax) and $105 million ($69 million after-tax) of losses related to mark-to-market adjustments and sales within the AEIDC investment portfolio in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, as well as AEBs compliance-related remediation costs of $71 million ($45 million after-tax) to implement a more robust compliance program, and regulatory and legal expenses and monetary penalties of $60 million pretax and
after-tax in 2007. 
CASH FLOWS 
Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
In 2009 and 2008, net cash provided by
operating activities exceeded net income, primarily due to provisions for losses, which do not require cash at the time of provision. Similarly, depreciation and amortization represent non-cash expenses. In addition, net cash was provided by net
income and higher accounts payable and other liabilities balances (including the Membership Rewards liability). These accounts vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments. 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by operating activities of $6.4 billion decreased compared to 2008. The decrease
was primarily due to a decrease in deferred taxes, acquisition costs and other, fluctuations in the Companys other receivables, accounts payable and other liabilities, as well as a reduction in income from continuing operations, partially
offset by changes in other assets. 
37 
Table of Contents
2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in non-cash provisions for losses and
deferred taxes, acquisition cost and other, offset by the outflow of cash resulting from fluctuations in the Companys other assets. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
The Companys investing activities primarily include funding cardmember loans and
receivables, securitizations of cardmember loans and receivables, and the Companys available-for-sale investment portfolio. 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, increased net cash used in investing activities of $6.8 billion compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $7.6 billion in 2008, due to lower proceeds from cardmember loan
securitizations primarily due to a decrease in maturities and redemptions of investments, and an increase in restricted cash required for related securitization activities. 
In 2008, net cash used in investing activities increased from 2007 primarily due to net decreases in cardmember receivables and loans
balances and cash provided by the sale of investments attributable to discontinued operations offset by cash used for acquisitions. 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
The Companys financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt,
taking customer deposits, paying dividends, and repurchasing its common and preferred shares. 
In 2009, net cash used in
financing activities of $4.6 billion decreased compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in customer deposits in 2009 and a reduction in cash used in financing activities attributable to discontinued operations in 2008. 
In 2008, net cash used in financing activities increased compared to 2007, primarily due to net repayments of debt and the net cash used in
financing activities attributable to discontinued operations, partially offset by a decrease in the repurchase of American Express common shares from 2007. 
CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS 
As a participant in the
financial services industry, the Company is subject to a wide array of regulations applicable to its businesses. The Company is a bank holding company and is subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve. As such, the Company is subject to the
Federal Reserves regulations and policies, including its regulatory capital requirements. In addition, the extreme disruptions in the capital markets since mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure of numerous financial institutions
have led to a number of proposals for changes in the financial services industry, including significant additional regulation and the potential formation of additional regulatory bodies. To that end, in the summer of 2009 legislation proposing
significant structural reforms to the financial services industry was introduced in the U.S. Congress. Among other things, the legislation proposes the establishment of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which would have broad authority to
regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services. Additional legislative proposals also call for substantive regulation across the financial services industry, such as new requirements for the
securitization market, including requiring sponsors of securitizations to retain a material economic interest in the credit risk associated with the underlying securitization. Legislative and regulatory changes could impact the profitability of the
Companys business activities, require the Company to change certain of its business practices and expose it to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). 
In recent years, there has been a heightened level of regulatory attention on banks and the payments industry in many countries. In May 2009,
the U.S. Congress passed, and the President of the United States signed into law, legislation to fundamentally reform credit card billing practices, pricing and disclosure requirements. This legislation accelerated the effective date and expanded
the scope of amendments to the rules regarding Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) and Truth in Lending Act that restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers, which were adopted in December
2008 by federal bank regulators in the United States. Together, the legislation and the regulatory amendments, portions of which became effective commencing August 2009, include, among other matters, rules relating to the imposition by card issuers
of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates. The Company is undertaking various actions to mitigate the impact of the legislation and the
amendments on its business and operations. In the event any actions undertaken by the Company to offset their impact are not effective, the legislation and amendments will likely have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of
operations. 
The credit and charge card industry also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants are
charged to accept cards. Although investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in four party payment
networks, like Visa and MasterCard) had largely been a subject of regulators outside the United States, legislation has been introduced in Congress designed to give merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate interchange collectively with card
networks and to regulate certain card network practices. Although, unlike the Visa and

38 
Table of Contents
2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

MasterCard networks, the American Express network does not collectively set fees, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard networks pricing could ultimately affect all
networks. 
In addition to the legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States regarding card practices and merchant
fees, other countries in which the Company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers and bankcard networks, which could have a material
adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. 
CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
The Companys balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: 
A solid and flexible equity capital profile; 
A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements; and 
Liquidity programs that enable the Company to satisfy all maturing financing obligations for at least a 12 month period should some or all of its
funding sources become inaccessible. 
CAPITAL STRATEGY 
The Companys objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base
and to provide flexibility to satisfy future business growth. The Company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value. 
The level and composition of the Companys equity capital are determined in large part by the Companys internal assessment of its
business activities, as well as rating agency and regulatory capital requirements. They are also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, and by conditions in the debt capital markets. The Company, as a bank holding
company, is subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain
off-balance sheet items. 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting for off-balance sheet
securitization activities beginning January 1, 2010, which resulted in the Company having to consolidate the assets (primarily cardmember loans) and liabilities (primarily debt certificates) of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust
(the Lending Trust). Both the cardmember loans and the debt will be consolidated by American Express Travel Related Services (TRS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a leading global payments and travel company, net of reserves for
expected credit losses. 
The following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the
Company and its significant banking subsidiaries, as well as some additional ratios for the Company widely utilized in the marketplace, at December 31, 2009. The respective pro forma ratios are also presented, assuming the Lending Trust was

evaluating the strength of the Companys capital position. See also footnote (a) above.

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
The Company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory
requirements; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the Companys business operations. 
The Companys primary source of equity capital has been through the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through
net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the growth in its capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, the Company has returned
excess capital to shareholders through its regular common dividend and the share repurchase program. 
The Company maintains
certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate. For example, the Company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements.
These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels for American Express Parent Company (Parent Company). 
During 2009, the Company returned $855 million in dividends to shareholders, which represents approximately 46 percent of total capital generated. 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM 
On January 9, 2009,
under the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), the Company issued to the Treasury Department for aggregate proceeds of $3.39 billion: (1) 3.39 million shares of Fixed Rate (5
percent) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares, Series A, and (2) a ten-year warrant (the Warrant) for the Treasury Department to purchase up to 24 million common shares at an exercise price of $20.95 per share. The Company repurchased the
Preferred Shares from the Treasury Department at par on June 17, 2009, and repurchased the Warrant for $340 million on July 29, 2009. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this program.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS 
The Company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. These share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of
employee compensation plans. 
On a cumulative basis, since 1994 the Company has distributed 67 percent of capital generated
through share repurchases and dividends. No shares have been repurchased over the past seven quarters, as share repurchases were suspended during the first quarter of 2008 in light of the challenging global economic environment and limitations while
under the CPP. 
FUNDING STRATEGY 
The Company seeks to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow it to meet its maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and
future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from
the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity, or investor. The mix of the Companys funding in any period will seek to achieve cost-efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity
objectives. The Companys funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities. 
The Companys proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international cardmember receivable and lending activities. The Companys borrowing needs are in
large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities, such as merchant payments. The Company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to
reimbursement by cardmembers and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period cardmember loans and receivables are outstanding. The Company also has additional borrowing needs associated with general corporate purposes. 
FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES 
The Company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources, including debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, deposits placed with the Companys U.S. banks by individuals and long-term
committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. markets.

The Companys funding strategy for 2010 is to raise funds to meet short-term borrowings outstanding, which includes short-term deposits, seasonal and other working capital needs, changes in receivables and other asset balances, while
maintaining sufficient cash and readily-marketable securities, which are easily convertible to cash, in order to be able to satisfy all maturing funding obligations for a 12 month period. The Company has $7.4 billion of unsecured long-term debt,
$10.2 billion of asset securitizations, and $2.6 billion of long-term deposits that will mature during 2010. 
The
Companys equity capital and funding strategies are designed to maintain appropriate and stable debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies (collectively the Credit Rating Agencies), Moodys Investor Services
(Moodys), Standard & Poors (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). There have been no changes to the ratings since second quarter 2009, however, both DBRS and S&P have recently revised
their ratings outlook from Negative to Stable.

Downgrades in the Companys unsecured debt or asset securitization programs securities ratings could result in higher interest expense on the
Companys unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit. In addition to increased funding costs, declines in credit ratings could reduce the Companys borrowing
capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. The Company believes that the change in its funding mix, which now includes an increasing proportion of U.S. retail deposits, should reduce the impacts that credit rating
downgrades would have on the Companys funding capacity and costs. 
SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS 
Short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt or time deposit with an original maturity of 12 months or less. The Companys
short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. Short-term borrowing decreased significantly in 2009 as part of the change in the Companys funding mix.
The amount of short-term borrowing issued in the future will depend on the Companys funding strategy, its needs and market conditions. 
The Company had the following short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31:

$10.8 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
American Express Credit Corporations (Credco) total back-up liquidity
coverage, which includes its undrawn committed bank facilities, was in excess of 100 percent of its net short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
DEPOSIT PROGRAMS 
The Company offers deposits within its Centurion Bank and FSB subsidiaries (together, the Banks). These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 through the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). During the second quarter of 2009, the Company, through FSB, launched a direct deposit-taking program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution
channels. This program, which currently represents a small portion of the Companys deposit program, makes FDIC-insured CDs and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. 
As of December 31, 2009, the Company held the following deposits:

The average original maturity and annual interest rate on outstanding U.S. retail CDs were 29 months and 2.3 percent, respectively. 
LONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS 
In 2009,
the Company and its subsidiaries issued debt and asset securitizations with maturities ranging from 2 to 10 years. These amounts included approximately $2.25 billion of AAA-rated lending securitization certificates and $6.7 billion of unsecured debt
across a variety of maturities and markets. During the year, the Company retained approximately $2.0 billion of subordinated securities, as the pricing and yields for these securities were not attractive for the Company due to market conditions. The
subordinated securities issued in the year included $1.5 billion of the new Class D securities, created as part of the actions to add further credit enhancement to the Lending Trust. 
The Companys 2009 offerings, which include those made by the Parent Company, Credco, American Express Canada Credit Corporation and the
Lending Trust, are presented in the following table on both a GAAP and managed basis:

ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS 
The
Company periodically securitizes cardmember receivables and loans arising from its card business, as the securitization market provides the Company with cost-effective funding. Securitization of cardmember receivables and loans is accomplished
through the transfer of those assets to a Trust, which in turn issues certificates or notes (securities) to third-party investors collateralized by the transferred assets. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to the Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Securitization transactions are accounted for as either a sale or secured borrowing, based upon the structure of the transaction and GAAP requirements applicable prior to
January 1, 2010. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the changes in GAAP requirements related to Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, effective January 1, 2010. 
Securitization of cardmember receivables generated under designated consumer charge card, small business charge card and corporate charge
card accounts is accomplished through the transfer of cardmember receivables to the American Express Issuance Trust (the Charge Trust).

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
Securitization of the Companys cardmember loans generated under designated consumer lending accounts is accomplished through the transfer
(as a sale) of cardmember loans to the Lending Trust. In a securitization structure like the Lending Trust (a revolving master trust), credit card accounts are selected and the rights to the current cardmember loans, as well as future cash flows
related to the corresponding accounts, are transferred to the Trust for the life of the accounts. 
Since the third quarter of
2007, the Company has typically been retaining some or all of subordinated securities issued as part of a transaction, due to prevailing market conditions. 
Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain events could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a
worst-case scenario, early amortization of investor certificates. For additional information about the Companys asset securitizations that could affect the Companys liquidity position, including three-month average excess spread rates
and other key metrics, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
On March 3, 2009, the Treasury
Department and the Federal Reserve launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which is currently set to expire on March 31, 2010. Securitized credit and charge card receivables are eligible collateral under the TALF,
provided the securities qualify for AAA ratings from two or more major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). The Company issued $2.25 billion in AAA rated TALF eligible securities during 2009. 
In an effort to address the concerns of the Credit Rating Agencies and the decline in the trust excess spread due to the performance of the
underlying credit card receivables in the Lending Trust and the related American Express Credit Account Secured Note Trusts (the Note Trusts), the subsidiaries of the Company that are the transferors of the Lending Trust undertook
certain actions during the second quarter of 2009 to adjust the credit enhancement structure of substantially all of the then outstanding series of securities previously issued by the Lending Trust and the Note Trusts. The actions entailed the
issuance of two new series of asset-backed securities, to provide additional credit enhancement to substantially all of the then outstanding series, and the exercise of a discount option with respect to new principal receivables arising in the
Lending Trust. The Company believes that these actions will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. These actions resulted in the inclusion of the Lending Trusts assets as risk-weighted assets for regulatory
capital purposes. For additional information regarding such actions, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The
Credit Rating Agencies are assessing the potential impact of the adoption of recently issued accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and for consolidation of variable interest entities (the Accounting Standards) on credit
ratings of the securities issued by securitization trusts within the overall asset-backed securities market. (The Accounting Standards, previously issued as FASB Statements Nos. 166 and 167, are discussed further in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.) In particular, the Credit Rating Agencies are assessing the FDICs safe harbor rule relating to the FDICs treatment of securitized assets in the event of a sponsoring financial institutions receivership or
conservatorship. Pursuant to the safe harbor rule, the FDIC will not reclaim any financial asset transferred in connection with a securitization, provided that such transfer meets all conditions for GAAP sale accounting. Because the adoption of the
Accounting Standards may cause some asset transfers to securitization trusts to no longer be deemed asset sales for accounting purposes within a companys consolidated group, the Credit Rating Agencies have indicated that they may ultimately
conclude that the safe harbor no longer applies and, in certain cases, that the highest rating an asset-backed security (ABS) could receive would be based on the sponsoring banks unsecured debt rating, rather than relying on their separate
evaluation of the securitization trust. Accordingly, the ability of the Companys securitization programs to receive or maintain AAA ratings on ABS securities under the same terms and conditions as it has done in the past, or at all, is subject
to uncertainty. Any action by the rating agencies as described above could adversely impact the Companys ability to utilize ABS as a source of funding for its business. 
LIQUIDITY STRATEGY 
The Company seeks to ensure that it has adequate liquidity in
the form of cash and readily-marketable securities easily convertible into cash, to satisfy all maturing funding obligations for a 12 month period, in addition to having access to significant additional contingent liquidity sources. This objective
is managed by regularly accessing capital through a broad and diverse set of funding programs, by maintaining a portfolio of cash and readily-marketable securities, as well as a variety of contingent sources of cash and financing. The Company
maintains a liquidity plan that enables it to continuously meet its financing obligations even when access to its primary funding sources become impaired or markets become inaccessible. 
In addition to its cash and readily-marketable securities, the Company continues to maintain a variety of contingent liquidity resources,
such as access to secured borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco through the Federal Reserve discount window and committed bank credit facilities. 
As a result of the Companys funding activities during 2009, the Company raised funds that substantially exceeded its 2009 funding needs. The excess increased the amount of cash and
readily-marketable securities the Company holds.

The Companys funding needs for 2010 are expected to arise from these debt and deposit maturities as well as changes in business needs, primarily changes in outstanding cardmember loans and receivables. 
The Company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains, such as economic and financial market conditions,
seasonality in business operations, growth in its businesses, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and Credit Rating Agency considerations. 
The yield the Company receives on its cash and readily-marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of
funding for these balances. Thus, the Company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts. The level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of its cash and readily-marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference
between its cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. 
Cash and Readily-Marketable Securities 
As of December 31, 2009, the Company held, as part of its contingent liquidity plan, a total of $19.0 billion of short-term instruments and $13.3
billion of longer-term readily-marketable securities. These investments are of high credit quality, highly liquid short-term instruments and longer-term, highly liquid instruments, such as U.S. Treasury securities, government-sponsored entity debt,
or government-guaranteed debt. These instruments are managed to either mature prior to the maturity of borrowings that will occur within the next 12 months, or are sufficiently liquid that the Company can sell them or enter into sale/repurchase
agreements to immediately raise cash proceeds to meet liquidity needs. 
Federal Reserve Discount Window 
The Banks are insured depository institutions that have the capability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of
qualifying collateral that they pledge. The Banks are approved to access the discount window, subject to the discretion of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and sufficient credit and charge card receivables pledged as collateral, thereby
providing them with an additional source of liquidity, if needed. 
The Company had approximately $33.2 billion as of
December 31, 2009, in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to
applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. 
Committed Bank Credit Facilities

The availability of the credit lines is subject to the Companys compliance with certain financial covenants, including the maintenance by the Company of consolidated tangible net worth of at least $4.1 billion, the maintenance by
Credco of a 1.25 ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges, and the compliance by the Banks with applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys consolidated tangible net worth
was approximately $11.6 billion, Credcos ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges was 1.59 and Centurion Bank and FSB each exceeded their regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. 
Committed bank credit facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which may preclude borrowing under the credit facilities.
The facilities may not be terminated should there be a change in the Companys credit rating. 
In consideration of all the
funding sources described above, the Company believes it would have access to liquidity to satisfy all maturing funding obligations for at least a 12-month period in the event that access to the secured and unsecured fixed income capital markets is
completely interrupted for that length of time. These events are not considered likely to occur. 
Parent Company Funding

Parent Company long-term debt outstanding was $10.2 billion and $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During
2009, the Parent Company issued $1.25 billion of 7.25 percent fixed-rate Senior Notes due 2014 and $1.75 billion of 8.13 percent fixed-rate Senior Notes due 2019. 
The Parent Company is authorized to issue commercial paper. This program is supported by a $1.25 billion multi-purpose committed bank credit facility. The credit facility will expire in 2010 and 2012 in
the amounts of $500 million and $750 million, respectively. There was no Parent Company commercial paper outstanding during 2009 and 2008, and no borrowings have been made under its bank credit facility. 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The above table excludes approximately $1.1 billion of tax liabilities that have been recorded in accordance with GAAP governing the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. 
(b)
Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place at December 31, 2009, and reflects the effect of existing interest rate
swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments. 
(c)
At December 31, 2009, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For
the U.S. American Express Supplemental Retirement Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2010 are anticipated to be approximately $88 million, and this amount has been included within other
long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $642 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other
long-term liabilities do not include $4.3 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as cardmembers in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point
redemption is not determinable. 
(d)
The purchase obligation amounts represent non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations by period under contracts that were in effect at December 31, 2009.
Termination fees are included in these amounts. 
The Company
also has certain contingent obligations to make payments under contractual agreements entered into as part of the ongoing operation of the Companys business, primarily with co-brand partners. The contingent obligations under such arrangements
were approximately $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2009. 
In addition to the contractual obligations noted above, the
Company has off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, retained interests in structured investments, unconsolidated variable interest entities and other off-balance sheet arrangements as more fully described below. 
GUARANTEES 
The Companys
principal guarantees are associated with cardmember services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had guarantees totaling approximately $67 billion related to cardmember protection plans,
as well as other guarantees in the ordinary course of business that are within the scope of GAAP governing the accounting for guarantees. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys
guarantees. 
CERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS 
As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $222 billion of unused credit available to cardmembers as part of
established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to cardmembers does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. The Companys charge card
products have no pre-set limit and, therefore, are not reflected in unused credit available to cardmembers. As discussed in the Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources section, the Companys securitizations of cardmember loans are also
off-balance sheet. The Companys cardmember receivables securitizations remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Refer
to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Companys other off-balance sheet arrangements.

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
GOVERNANCE 
The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board approves the Companys
Enterprise-wide Risk Management Policy, which defines risk management objectives, risk appetite, risk limits and escalation triggers, and establishes the internal governance structure for managing risk. The Policy focuses on the major risks that are
relevant to the Company given its business model  credit risk (institutional and individual), operational risk, market risk and reputational risk. Internal management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC),
chaired by the Companys Chief Risk Officer, and the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Companys Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for implementing the Policy across the Company. 
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss due to obligor or counterparty default. Credit risks in the Company are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management tools and metrics.
Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by Chief Credit Officers. To preserve independence, Chief Credit Officers for all
business units have a solid line reporting relationship to the Companys Chief Risk Officer. 
INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK

Individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These
portfolios consist of millions of borrowers across multiple geographies, occupations, industries and levels of net worth. The Company benefits from the attractive profile of its cardmembers, which is driven by brand, underwriting, and customer
management policies, premium customer servicing, and product reward features. The risk in these portfolios is correlated with broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, and home values, as well as customer liquidity, which can
have a material effect on credit performance. 
General principles and the overall framework for managing individual credit risk
across the Company are defined in the Individual Credit Risk Policy approved by the ERMC. The Credit Policy Committee is responsible for implementation and enforcement of this policy and for providing guidance to the Underwriting and Credit Strategy
Committees as well as to the Chief Credit Officers of respective business units. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and practices covering all facets of credit extension, including prospecting, approvals, authorizations, line
management, collections, and fraud prevention. These policies are designed to assure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition. 
Individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date
proprietary information on customers, such as spending and payment history, data feeds from credit bureaus, and mortgage information. Additional data, such as home value and other new commercial variables designed to better manage small business
risk, were integrated into the Companys models in the early stages of the recent economic downturn to further mitigate risk. The Company has developed unique decision logic for each customer interaction, including prospect targeting, new
account approvals, line assignment, balance transfers, cross selling and overall account management and collection. 
INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK 
Institutional credit risk arises principally within the Companys Global Corporate Card
Services, Merchant Services and Network Services businesses, and from the Companys investment activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected
both by general economic conditions and by company-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss
events in such portfolios. 
General principles and the overall framework for managing institutional credit risk across the
Company are defined in the Institutional Credit Risk Policy approved by the ERMC. The Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC) is responsible for implementation and enforcement of this policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers
of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures, who in turn make investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensure proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation,
monitor risk exposures, and determine risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC
provides guidance to business unit risk teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A company-wide risk rating utility and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of institutional obligors. 
MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. The Companys market risk exposure is primarily generated by: 
Interest rate risk in its card, insurance and Travelers Cheque businesses, as well as its investment portfolios; and 
Foreign exchange risk in its international operations.

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
General principles and the overall framework for managing market risk across the Company are defined in the Market Risk Policy, which is the
responsibility of the ALCO. Market Risk limits and escalation triggers within that policy are approved by ALCO and by the ERMC. Market risk is centrally monitored for compliance with policy and limits by the Market Risk Committee, which reports into
the ALCO and is chaired by the Chief Market Risk Officer. Market risk management is also guided by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding and liquidity and investments. Derivative financial instruments derive their
value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity indices or prices. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason,
are an integral component of the Companys market risk management. Use of derivative financial instruments is incorporated into the discussion below as well as Note 12. 
The Companys market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of its products and services. Interest rate risk arises
through the funding of cardmember receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR. 
Interest rate exposure within the Companys charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total
funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable- rate or to convert
variable-rate debt to fixed-rate. The Company may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors. The majority of its cardmember loans, which are linked to a benchmark
rate such as PRIME that can reprice monthly, are funded with variable-rate funding, the majority of which are linked to LIBOR that reprice monthly. 
The Company regularly reviews its interest rate exposure profile and may modify it. Derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, with notional amounts of approximately $17 billion and
$18 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These derivatives generally qualify for hedge accounting. A portion of these derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2009, extend to 2018. The Company does not
engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
The detrimental effect on the Companys pretax earnings
of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $117 million ($75 million related to the U.S. dollar), based on the 2009 year-end positions. This effect, which is calculated using a static asset liability gapping
model, is primarily determined by the volume of variable-rate funding of charge card and fixed-rate lending products for which the interest rate exposure is not managed by derivative financial instruments. As of year end 2009, the percentage of
total worldwide managed loans that were deemed to be fixed-rate was 34 percent, with the remaining 66 percent deemed to be variable rate. 
The Company is also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark Prime rate that determines the yield on its variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark LIBOR rate
that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of its outstanding debt, including asset securitizations. Simultaneous and identically-sized changes in the same direction of these two indices do not contribute to the market risk
described above, as there is no material mismatch in the effective repricing frequency of these two indices. However, differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would impact the Companys
variable-rate U.S. lending net interest margins because the Company borrows at rates based on LIBOR but lends to its customers based on the Prime rate. The detrimental effect on the Companys pretax earnings of a hypothetical 10 basis point
decrease in the spread between Prime and 1 month LIBOR over the next 12 months is estimated to be $38 million. The Company currently has approximately $38.2 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables that are funded with
LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. The spread relationship has been more volatile over the last 2
 1
2
 years than in preceding historical periods. For example, the spread experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 was very low by historical standards and reduced net interest
margins; during the fourth quarter of 2009, the spread was high by historical standards, which had the effect of temporarily increasing the Companys net interest margin from prior periods. 
Foreign exchange risk is generated by cardmember cross-currency charges, foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in
international units. The Companys foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economically justified through various
means, including the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forwards, options, and cross-currency swap contracts, which can help lock in the value of the Companys exposure to specific currencies.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, foreign currency hedge instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $19
billion and $17 billion, respectively, were outstanding. Derivative hedging activities related to cross-currency charges, balance sheet exposures, and foreign currency earnings generally do not qualify for hedge accounting; however, derivative
hedging activities related to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity generally do. 
With respect to cross-currency
charges and balance sheet exposures, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the effect on the Companys earnings

48

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

of a hypothetical 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar would be immaterial as of December 31, 2009. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse
impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $112 million as of December 31, 2009. With respect to
translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening in the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in equity as of
December 31, 2009. 
The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other
factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, and changes in the volume and mix of the Companys businesses. 
FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
Funding & liquidity risk is defined as the inability to access cash and equivalents needed to meet business requirements and satisfy the Companys obligations. General principles and the
overall framework for managing liquidity risk across the Company are defined in the Liquidity Risk Policy, which is the responsibility of the ALCO. The Company balances the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and
limit financial flexibility, with having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee, which reports into the ALCO and is chaired by
the Corporate Treasurer. The Company has developed a liquidity plan that enables it to meet its daily cash obligations when access to both unsecured and secured funds in the debt capital markets is impaired or unavailable. This plan is designed to
ensure that the Company and all of its main operating entities could continuously meet their maturing debt obligations for a 12-month period in which their access to all capital markets and deposit financing is interrupted. 
Liquidity risk is managed both at an aggregate company level and at the major legal entities in order to ensure that sufficient funding and
liquidity resources are available in the amount and in the location needed in a stress event. The Funding and Liquidity Committee manages the forecasts of the Companys aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, the
funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required, and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. Liquidity planning also takes
into account operating cash flexibilities. 
OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
The Company defines operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due
to inadequate or failed processes or information systems, human error or the external environment (e.g., natural disasters) including losses due to failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities
and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal or regulatory penalties. Current areas of significant focus include data protection, anti-money laundering, vendor risk,
impact of organizational change, financial reporting risk and both internal and external fraud. 
The general principles and the
overall framework for managing operational risk across the Company are defined in the Operational Risk Policy approved by the ERMC. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) provides governance for the operational risk framework. 
In order to appropriately measure operational risk, the Company has developed a comprehensive operational risk model. This model assesses
(i) risk events, i.e. what occurred or could have occurred; (ii) root causes, i.e. why did it occur or could have occurred; and (iii) impact, i.e. how was the Company affected or might have been affected. The impact on the Company is
assessed from a financial, brand, regulatory and legal perspective. The operational risk model also assesses the frequency and likelihood that events may occur again so that the appropriate mitigation steps may be taken. 
Additionally, the Company uses an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor, and report inherent and emerging operational
risks. This framework consists of a) the ORMC oversight, b) an operational risk event capture process, and c) process and entity-level risk self-assessments. 
The process risk self-assessment methodology is used to facilitate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and is also used for non-financial operational risk self- assessments. This
methodology involves identifying key processes across the Company and then determining the inherent operational risks. Once these risks have been identified, the existing control environment is defined, key controls are tested and relevant issues
are escalated to the appropriate governing bodies. 
The operational risk framework also includes the entity risk
self-assessment. This is a risk workshop where senior leaders identify the key operational risks that the business unit or support group faces and determines the Companys preparedness to respond should these risks occur. Top risks are tracked
to ensure that the appropriate monitoring or mitigation is in place. 
Managing enterprise risk is an important priority for the
Company and the program continues to evolve.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS 
The Company is a global service company principally engaged in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Card Services (USCS), International Card Services (ICS), Global Commercial
Services (GCS) and Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS). 
The Company considers a combination of factors when
evaluating the composition of its reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels,
geographic considerations (primarily U.S. versus international), and regulatory environment considerations. Refer to Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of products and services by segment. 
Results of the business segments essentially treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives
these results allocates income and expense using various methodologies as described below. 
TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST
EXPENSE 
The Company allocates discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Segments earn
discount revenue based on the volume of merchant business generated by cardmembers. Within the USCS, ICS, and GCS segments, discount revenue reflects the issuer component of the overall discount rate; within the GNMS segment, discount revenue
reflects the network and merchant component of the overall discount rate. Total interest income and net card fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. 
PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES 
The provisions for losses are directly attributable to the
segment in which they are reported. 
EXPENSES 
Marketing and promotion expenses are reflected in each segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of brand advertising, which is primarily reflected in the GNMS and USCS segments.
Rewards and cardmember services expenses are reflected in each segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment. 
Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications, reflect expenses incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to the
Companys support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated to
segments based on each segments relative level of pretax income. Financing requirements are managed on a consolidated basis. Funding costs are allocated based on segment funding requirements. 
CAPITAL 
Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.
Business model operating requirements include capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures include considerations for credit, market, and operational risk. 
INCOME TAXES 
Income tax provision
(benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to various businesses that make up the segment.

Segment capital at the end of each respective period represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and
regulatory capital requirements. 
(c)
Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($249 million, $852 million and $1.8 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively)
by (ii) average segment capital ($5.6 billion, $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the
computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $432 million, $243 million and $170 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes the return on average
tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business. 
(d)
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in USCS are written off to 180 days past due, consistent
with applicable bank regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past billing. The net write-offs for 2008 include approximately $341 million resulting from this write-off methodology change, which is not reflected in
the table above. If the $341 million had been included in USCS write-offs, the net write-off rate would have been 5.4 percent for 2008.

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009  GAAP BASIS

The following discussion of USCS segment results of operations is presented on a GAAP basis. 
USCS reported segment income of $249 million for 2009, a $603 million or 71 percent decrease from $852 million in 2008, which decreased
$971million or 53 percent from 2007. 
Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 
In 2009, USCS total revenues net of interest expense decreased $2.1 billion or 15 percent to $11.9 billion due to lower securitization income, net, decreased
interest income and lower discount revenue, net card fees and other, partially offset by lower interest expense. Discount revenue, net card fees and other of $9.1 billion in 2009 decreased $1.2 billion or 12 percent from 2008, due to lower billed
business volumes, reduced other commissions and fees, decreased net card fees, lower other revenues and reduced travel commissions and fees. The decrease in billed business reflected a 10 percent decrease in basic cards-in-force and a 5 percent
decline in average basic cardmember spending. In 2009 within USCS, small business and consumer billed business volumes declined 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Interest income of $3.2 billion in 2009 was $1.5 billion or 32 percent lower
than in 2008, primarily due to lower portfolio yields and a decrease in average owned lending balances. Interest expense of $855 million in 2009 decreased $1.3 billion or 61 percent as compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower market interest
rate-driven cost of funds and reduced average owned cardmember loans and receivable balances. Total revenues net of interest expense of $14.0 billion in 2008 were $225 million or 2 percent lower than 2007 as a result of lower securitization income,
net, decreased other commissions and fees and lower interest income, partially offset by slightly higher discount revenue, net card fees and other, as well as lower interest expense. 
Provisions for Losses 
Provisions for losses decreased $620 million or 14 percent
to $3.8 billion for 2009 compared to 2008, due to lower loan balances and improving credit indicators during the second half of 2009. The lending net write-off rate increased in the first half of the year and then began to improve in the third and
fourth quarter. Past due rates rose early in the year but then showed improvement through the remainder of the year commencing in the second quarter. The write-off and past due rates reflect in part targeted efforts to manage credit performance such
as reducing high loan balances, as well as the impact of customer assistance programs, including the re-aging of cardmember accounts meeting certain criteria. 
Provisions for losses increased $1.4 billion or 46 percent to $4.4 billion for 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher write-off and delinquency rates in the lending and charge portfolios reflecting the
challenging U.S. credit environment. 
Expenses

During 2009, USCS expenses decreased $669 million or 8 percent to $7.8 billion, due to lower marketing, promotion, rewards and
cardmember services expenses and lower salaries and employee benefits and total operating expenses. Expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, included $12 million, $30 million, and $13 million, respectively, of charges related to reengineering activities
primarily related to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2009 and 2008 as previously discussed and reengineering activities within consumer and small business services in 2007. Expenses in 2008 of $8.5 billion were $27 million or less
than 1 percent lower than in 2007, due to lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses, partially offset by greater salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, net. 
Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $571 million or 12 percent in 2009 to $4.3 billion, due to lower
rewards costs, reduced marketing and promotion expenses and the Delta-related charge to the Membership Reward balance sheet reserve in the fourth quarter of 2008. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $303 million
or 6 percent in 2008 to $4.8 billion, due to the Membership Rewards related charge in 2007 noted above, the incremental business-building expenses in 2007 compared to lower marketing and promotion expenses in 2008, partially offset by the
Delta-related charge in 2008 to increase the Membership Rewards liability and higher volume-related rewards costs. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of $3.5 billion in 2009 decreased $98 million or 3 percent from 2008,
reflecting the benefits from reengineering activities, lower net charges associated with these reengineering programs, the favorable impact in 2008 related to fair value hedge ineffectiveness and the costs related to the Delta contract extension in
the fourth quarter of 2008. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of $3.6 billion in 2008 increased $276 million or 8 percent from 2007. The increase was due to higher software, operations, technology and credit and collection
costs, the pension-related gain in 2007 and costs related to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2008. 
Income
Taxes 
The effective tax rate was 23 percent for 2009 compared to 25 percent and 33 percent for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The rates for each
of these years reflect tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years tax items.

GAAP and managed basis as described below will no longer be applicable beginning in 2010. 
For USCS, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as
if they were in the Companys balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount
revenue, net card fees and other in the USCS Selected Financial Information), interest income, interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no
securitization transactions have occurred. 
The Company presents USCS information on a managed basis because that is the way
the Companys management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Companys cardmember loans business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized
cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember loans business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for
management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember loans portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also
important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Companys performance and can only be properly assessed when all
non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans. 
On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Companys income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for losses
for cardmember loans. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Companys balance sheet, and the resulting gain on sale is reflected in securitization income, net as well as an impact to
provisions for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as excess spread)
related to the interests sold to investors (i.e., the investors interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of interest-only strips, are reflected in securitization income, net and fees and commissions. The Company also
recognizes total interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e., the sellers interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase,
and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses. 
As presented, in aggregate over
the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs).
The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009  MANAGED BASIS

The following discussion of USCS is on a managed basis. 
Discount revenue, net card fees and other in 2009 decreased $1.3 billion or 12 percent to $9.5 billion, due to lower billed business volumes, reduced other commissions and fees, decreased net card fees,
lower other revenues and reduced travel commissions and fees. Discount revenue, net card fees and other in 2008 increased $204 million or 2 percent to $10.8 billion, largely due to higher net card fees, greater other revenues, higher travel
commissions and fees, and increased discount revenues, which were partially offset by lower other commissions and fees. Interest income in 2009 of $6.3 billion decreased by $1.9 billion or 23 percent, due to a decline in the average managed lending
balance and a lower portfolio yield, offset by the benefits of certain repricing initiatives during 2009. Interest income in 2008 of $8.2 billion remained flat as lower market interest rate-driven yields more than offset the 10 percent growth in
average managed lending balances. Interest expense in 2009 decreased $1.9 billion or 63 percent to $1.1 billion, due to a lower market interest rate-driven cost of funds and lower average managed cardmember loans and receivable balances, as well as
the movement of liquidity-related interest expense to the Corporate & Other segment. In 2008, interest expense decreased $793 million or 21 percent to $3.0 billion due to a lower market interest rate-driven cost of funds, which more than
offset higher average managed receivable balances. Provisions for losses decreased 1 percent in 2009, driven by a lower average loan and receivable balance and improved charge card credit performance, partially offset by a higher lending write-off
level versus 2008. Provisions for losses increased $2.5 billion or 65 percent to $6.4 billion in 2008, reflecting the impact of higher write-off and delinquency rates and higher average managed loan balances, partially offset by the credit-related
charge in 2007.

(b)
Segment capital at the end of each respective period represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and
regulatory capital requirements. 
(c)
Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($303 million, $351 million, and $291 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively) by (ii) average segment capital ($2.1 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.9 billion for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital
except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $551 million, $544 million, and $539 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company believes the return on
average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business. 
(d)
A cardmember account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the cardmembers billing statement date. In addition, if
the Company initiates collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated cardmember receivable balance is considered as 90 days past billing. A cardmember account becomes past due if payment is not
received within 30 days after the billing statement date. 
(e)
See below for calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans and the ratio of net interest income divided by average loans. The Company believes net interest
yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Companys cardmember loans portfolio. 
(f)
This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio, and thus is not
representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans, and interest expense
attributable to other activities, including cardmember receivables.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 
ICS reported segment income of $303 million for 2009, a $48 million or 14 percent decrease from $351 million in 2008, which increased $60 million or 21 percent from 2007. A significant portion of ICS
segment income in 2009 and 2008 is attributable to the Companys internal tax allocation process. See further discussion in the Income Tax section below. 
Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 
In 2009, ICS total revenues net of
interest expense decreased $298 million or 6 percent to $4.5 billion compared to 2008 due to lower discount revenue, net card fees and other and decreased interest income, partially offset by lower interest expense. Discount revenue, net card fees,
and other revenues decreased $354 million or 9 percent to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by the lower level of card spending, decreased other commissions and fees, lower other revenues and reduced travel commissions and
fees, partially offset by an increase in net card fees. The 11 percent decrease

in billed business in 2009 reflected a 6 percent decrease in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and an 8 percent decrease in basic cards-in-force. Assuming no changes in
foreign currency exchange rates from 2008 to 2009, billed business decreased 4 percent and average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force increased 1 percent in 2009. Volume comparisons within the major geographic regions ranged from a
low-single-digit increase in Latin America to mid-single-digit decreases in Asia Pacific, Europe and Canada
3
. Interest income declined $396 million or 20 percent to $1.6 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an 18
percent reduction in average cardmember loans and lower interest on bank and other deposits, partially offset by a higher cardmember loan portfolio yield. Interest expense of $509 million in 2009 declined $452 million or 47 percent, as compared to
2008, due to lower average loan and receivable balances, as well as a decreased cost of funds. Total revenues net of interest expense of $4.8 billion in 2008 were $450 million or 10 percent higher than 2007 due to higher discount revenue, net card
fees and other and increased interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
Provisions for Losses 
Provisions for losses increased $181 million or 18 percent to $1.2 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a higher lending reserve level.
Provisions for losses increased $218 million or 27 percent to $1.0 billion in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to increased reserve levels due to the challenging economic environment and loan and business volume growth. 
Expenses 
During 2009, ICS
expenses decreased $556 million or 15 percent to $3.0 billion compared to 2008, due to lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and decreased salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses. Expenses in 2009, 2008, and
2007, included $4 million, $83 million, and $16 million, respectively, of reengineering costs primarily related to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2009 and 2008 as previously

discussed and reengineering in the international payments business for 2007. Expenses in 2008 of $3.6 billion were $196 million
or 6 percent higher than 2007, due to increased salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs. 
Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $232 million or 16 percent to $1.2 billion in 2009 compared to 2008,
reflecting reduced marketing and promotion expenses through the first nine months of 2009 and lower reward costs. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $113 million or 7 percent to $1.5 billion in 2008 compared to
2007, due to the Membership Rewards related charge and the incremental business-building costs in 2007 noted above, which more than offset higher marketing and promotion expenses, and volume-related rewards costs in 2008. Salaries and employee
benefits and other operating expenses decreased $324 million or 15 percent to $1.8 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to benefits from the Companys reengineering activities and lower net charges during 2009 related to
reengineering initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $309 million or 17 percent to $2.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense and increased other
operating expenses, which reflected the costs related to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2008, as well as greater professional services expense. 
Income Taxes 
The effective tax rate was negative 32 percent in 2009 versus
negative 129 percent in 2008 and negative 149 percent in 2007. ICS includes a tax benefit of $73 million and $198 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, since the Companys internal tax allocation process provides this segment with the
consolidated benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the United States. The tax benefit is likely to continue, because Congress is expected to extend the law that provides the basis for the benefit.

Segment capital at the end of each respective period represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and
regulatory capital requirements. 
(c)
Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($390 million, $505 million and $536 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively)
by (ii) average segment capital ($3.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.1 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the
computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $881 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes the return on average
tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business. 
(d)
A cardmember account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the cardmembers billing statement date. In addition, if
the Company initiates collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated cardmember receivable balance is considered as 90 days past billing. A cardmember account becomes past due if payment is not
received within 30 days after the billing statement date.

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 
GCS reported segment income of $390 million for 2009, a $115 million or 23 percent decrease from $505 million in 2008, which decreased $31 million or 6
percent from 2007. 
Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 
In 2009, GCS total revenues net of interest expense decreased $650 million or 14 percent to $4.0 billion due to decreased discount
revenue, net card fees, and other revenues and lower interest income, partially offset by lower interest expense. Discount revenue, net card fees, and other revenues decreased $924 million or 18 percent to $4.2 billion in 2009 primarily driven by
lower travel commissions and fees, the reduced level of card spending, decreased other revenues and reduced other commissions and fees. The 14 percent decrease in billed business in 2009 reflected a 16 percent decrease in average spending per
proprietary basic card. Assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2008 to 2009, billed business and average spending per proprietary basic card decreased 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in 2009 with volume decreases within
the United States of 11 percent compared to results within the Companys other major geographic regions ranging from the mid-teen-digit declines in Europe and Asia Pacific, a low-teen-digit decrease in Canada, and a mid-single-digit increase in
Latin America
4
. Interest income decreased $107 million or
64 percent to $61 million in 2009 compared to 2008, driven by lower rates within deposit-related income. Interest expense decreased $381 million or 69 percent to $172 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a lower cost of funds and average
receivable balance, partially offset by the cost of funding the CPS acquisition. Total revenues net of interest expense of $4.7 billion in 2008 were $427 million or 10 percent higher than 2007 due to increased discount revenue, net card fees, and
other revenue and lower interest expense. 
Provisions for Losses 
Provisions for losses decreased $54 million or 23 percent to $177 million in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting improved credit trends as 2009 progressed. Provisions for losses increased $68 million or 42
percent to $231 million in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting higher loss and past due rates due to the challenging economic environment. 
4
Refer to footnote 2 on page 34 under Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2009 relating to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Expenses 
During 2009 GCS expenses decreased $471 million or 12 percent to $3.3 billion, reflecting a reduction of $426 million in salaries and employee benefits
and other operating expenses as described below, as well as lower rewards costs, lower net charges associated with reengineering initiatives in 2009, and the Delta-related increase in the Membership Rewards balance sheet reserve in the fourth
quarter of 2008. Expenses in 2009, 2008 and 2007, included $101 million, $138 million, and $25 million, respectively, of reengineering costs, primarily reflecting the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2009 and 2008 as previously discussed
and reengineering costs, primarily in business travel in 2007. Expenses in 2008 of $3.8 billion were $410 million or 12 percent higher than 2007, primarily due to greater salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses. 
Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $45 million or 12 percent to $332 million in 2009 compared to 2008,
primarily reflecting lower rewards costs in 2009 and the Delta-related increase in the Membership Rewards balance sheet reserve in the fourth quarter of 2008. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $10 million or 3
percent to $377 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the Membership Rewards related charge in 2007, offset by higher volume-related rewards costs and the Delta-related charge in 2008 to increase the Membership Rewards liability.
Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $426 million or 13 percent to $3.0 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting the benefits from the Companys reengineering initiatives, partially offset by lower net
charges associated with these programs during 2009. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $420 million or 14 percent to $3.4 billion in 2008 compared to 2007, due to higher other operating expenses and greater
salaries and employee benefits expense, which reflected the impacts of the CPS acquisition, as well as the costs related to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2008 and the pension-related gain in 2007. 
Income Taxes 
The effective tax
rate was 31 percent in 2009 versus 27 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2007.

(a)
See Glossary of Selected Terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information. 
(b)
Global Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain
insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. 
(c)
Segment capital at the end of each respective period represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and
regulatory capital requirements. 
(d)
Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($898 million, $995 million and $1.0 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively)
by (ii) average segment capital ($1.7 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the
computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $36 million, $35 million and $33 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes the return on average
tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business. 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR
THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 
GNMS reported segment income of $898 million in 2009, a $97 million or 10 percent decrease from $995
million in 2008, which decreased $27 million or 3 percent from 2007. 
Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 
GNMS total revenues net of interest expense decreased $386 million or 9 percent to $3.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, due to decreased discount
revenue, net card fees and other and decreased interest expense credit. Discount revenue, fees and other revenues decreased $250 million or 6 percent to $3.6 billion in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting a decline in merchant-related revenues, due to
the 9 percent decrease in global card billed business, partially offset by higher GNS-related revenues. Interest expense credit decreased $137 million or 62 percent to $85 million in 2009 compared to 2008, due to a lower rate-driven interest credit
related to internal transfer pricing, which recognizes the merchant services accounts payable-related funding benefit. Total revenues net of interest expense of $4.1 billion in 2008 were $238 million or 6 percent higher compared to 2007 due to
increased discount revenue, fees and other revenues offset by lower interest expense credit. 
Provisions for Losses

Provisions for losses increased $8 million or 6 percent to $135 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily driven by the higher provisions in
GNS. Provisions for losses in 2008 increased $24 million or 23 percent to $127 million compared to 2007, primarily reflecting merchant-related provisions. 
Expenses 
During 2009, GNMS expenses decreased $285 million or 11 percent to
$2.2 billion compared to 2008. Expenses in 2009, 2008 and 2007, included $22 million, $31 million and $6 million of reengineering costs, respectively, primarily related

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2009 and 2008 as previously discussed. Expenses in 2008 of $2.5 billion were $284 million or 13 percent higher than 2007, due to increased
salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing and promotion expenses. 
Marketing and promotion expenses decreased $32 million or 6 percent to $521 million in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting lower brand and merchant-related marketing costs during the first nine months of 2009. Marketing and promotion expenses
decreased 7 percent in 2008 to $553 million compared to 2007, reflecting lower brand and other marketing and promotion expenses as compared to incremental business-building costs in 2007. 
Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $253 million or 13 percent to $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008,
primarily reflecting the benefits from the Companys reengineering initiatives. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $326 million or 20 percent to $1.9 billion in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to
increased merchant-related reserve due to the challenging economic environment, 2007 gains related to the sale of the Companys merchant-related operations in Russia, greater salaries and employee benefits expense, which reflected the expansion
of the merchant sales force and the costs related to the Companys reengineering initiatives in 2008 and higher volume-related expenses. 
Income Taxes 
The effective tax rate was 35 percent in 2009, 33 percent in 2008 and 34 percent in 2007. 
CORPORATE & OTHER 
Corporate & Other had net income of $297 million, $168 million and $454 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net income in 2009 reflected the $372 million and $172 million after-tax income related to the MasterCard and
Visa litigation settlements, respectively, and $135 million of after-tax income related to the ICBC sale. 
In the third quarter
of 2009, the Company recorded a $180 million ($113 million after-tax) benefit associated with the Companys accounting for a net investment in consolidated foreign subsidiaries. $135 million ($85 million after-tax) of this benefit represents
the correction of an error related to the accounting for cumulative translation adjustments in prior periods. The error resulted in a $60 million ($38 million after-tax) income overstatement in the second quarter of 2009, a $135 million ($85 million
after-tax) income understatement in the fourth quarter of 2008 and minimal amounts for all other periods affected dating back to the third quarter of 2007, when the incorrect accounting originated. Also included in the $180 million is a
non-recurring $45 million ($28 million after-tax) related benefit which was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of changes in the fair value of certain foreign exchange forward contracts that are economic hedges to foreign currency
exposures of net investments in consolidated foreign subsidiaries. Reengineering costs of $35 million after-tax, $108 million after-tax and $4 million after-tax, for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily related to the Companys
reengineering initiatives previously discussed. 
Net income in 2008 reflected the $186 million and $172 million after-tax
income related to the MasterCard and Visa litigation settlements, respectively, offset by a $19 million after-tax charge primarily relating to the ongoing AEB operations retained by the Company in the first quarter of 2008. 
Net income in 2007 reflected the $700 million after-tax gain resulting from the initial $1.13 billion due March 31, 2008, from Visa as
part of the litigation settlement. This was partially offset by a $46 million after-tax litigation related charge, and a $31 million after-tax charge for the contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund. 
EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY 
The
Company has multiple co-brand relationships and rewards partners, of which airlines are one of the most important and valuable. The Companys largest airline co-brand is Delta Air Lines (Delta) and this relationship includes exclusive co-brand
credit card partnerships and other arrangements, including Membership Rewards, merchant acceptance and travel. American Express Delta SkyMiles Credit Card co-brand portfolio accounts for approximately 5 percent of the Companys worldwide
billed business and less than 15 percent of worldwide cardmember lending receivables. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of prepaid miles acquired from Delta. 
Over the last couple of years, there were a significant number of airline bankruptcies and liquidations, driven in part by volatile fuel
costs and weakening economies around the world. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant revenue declines when a particular airline scales back or ceases operations due to a bankruptcy or other financial challenges because volumes
generated by that airline are typically shifted to other participants in the industry that accept the Companys card products. The Companys exposure to business and credit risk in the airline industry is primarily through business
arrangements where the Company has remitted payment to the airline for a cardmember purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown. The Company mitigates this risk by delaying payment to the airlines with deteriorating
financial situations, thereby increasing cash withheld to protect the Company in the event the airline is liquidated. To date, the Company has not experienced significant losses from airlines that have ceased operations.

OTHER REPORTING MATTERS 
ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
See the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY 
Adjusted average loans
  Represents average cardmember loans on an owned or managed basis, as applicable, excluding the impact of deferred card
fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans on an owned or managed basis, as applicable. 
Adjusted
net interest income
  Represents net interest income allocated to the Companys cardmember loans portfolio on an owned or managed basis, as applicable, which excludes the impact of card fees on loans and balance transfer fees
attributable to the Companys cardmember loans portfolio on an owned or managed basis, as applicable. 
Asset
securitizations
  Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred
to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. 
Average discount rate
  This calculation is designed to approximate merchant pricing. It represents the percentage of billed
business (both proprietary and GNS) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. 
Basic cards-in-force
  Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that
account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network
partnership agreements. 
Billed business
  Represents the dollar amount of charges on all American Express cards;
also referred to as spend or charge volume. Proprietary billed business includes charges made on the Companys proprietary cards-in-force, cash advances on proprietary cards and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.
Non-proprietary billed business represents the charges through the Companys global network on cards issued by the Companys network partners. Billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where
the cardmember is domiciled. 
Capital asset pricing model
  Generates an appropriate discount rate using internal
and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing uncertainty inherent in an investment. 
Capital ratios
  Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on and
off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. 
Card acquisition
  Primarily represents the
issuance of new cards to either new or existing cardmembers through marketing and promotion efforts. 
Cardmember 

The individual holder of an issued American Express branded charge or credit card. 
Cardmember loans
  Represents
the outstanding amount due from cardmembers for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Cardmember loans also include balances with extended payment terms on certain charge card
products and are net of unearned revenue. 
Cardmember receivables
  Represents the outstanding amount due from
cardmembers for charges made on their American Express charge cards as well as any card-related fees. 
Charge cards

 Represents cards that carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Cardmembers generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are
assessed on charge cards. 
Credit cards
  Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace
periods, and rate and fee structures. 
Discount revenue
  Represents revenue earned from fees charged to merchants
with whom the Company has entered into a card acceptance agreement for processing cardmember transactions. The discount fee generally is deducted from the Companys payment reimbursing the merchant for cardmember purchases. Such amounts are
reduced by contra- revenue such as payments to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs and corporate incentive payments. 
Interest expense 
 Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund cardmember loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is
recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into three categories (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, (ii) short-term borrowings, which primarily
relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings, and (iii) long-term debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on the Companys long-term debt. 
Interest income 
 Interest and fees on loans includes interest on loans which is assessed using the average daily balance
method for loans owned. These amounts are recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written-off. Loan fees are deferred and
recognized in interest income

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

on a straight-line basis over the 12-month card membership period, net of deferred direct card acquisition costs and a reserve for projected membership cancellation. 
Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to the Companys performing fixed-income securities. Interest income
is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance
throughout its term. These amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. 
Interest income on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits,
overnight sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts. 
Interest-only strip
  Interest-only
strips are generated from USCS securitization activity and are a form of retained interest held by the Company in the securitization. This financial instrument represents the present value of estimated future positive excess spread
expected to be generated by the securitized assets over the estimated life of those assets. Excess spread is the net cash flow from interest and fee collections allocated to the third-party investors interests in the securitization after
deducting the interest paid on the investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees, and other expenses. 
Merchant acquisition
  Represents the signing of merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. 
Net card fees
  Represents the charge card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of provision for projected refunds for
cancellation of card membership. 
Net interest yield on cardmember loans
  Represents the net spread earned on
cardmember loans. Net interest yield on cardmember loans (both on an owned and managed basis) is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on
cardmember loans (both on an owned and managed basis) includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For the owned and managed basis presentation, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for
losses  cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation. 
Net loss ratio
  Represents the ratio of charge card write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized and unauthorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on cardmember receivables expressed as a
percentage of gross amounts billed to cardmembers. 
Net write-off rate
  Represents the amount of cardmember loans
or USCS cardmember receivables written off consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or USCS average receivables during the period. 
Return on average equity
  Calculated by dividing one year period net income by one year average total shareholders equity.

Return on average tangible common equity 
 Computed in the same manner as ROE except the computation of average
tangible common shareholders equity excludes average goodwill and other intangibles. 
Return on average segment
capital 
 Calculated by dividing one year period segment income by one year average segment capital. 
Return on
average tangible segment capital 
 Computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles. 
Risk-weighted assets
  Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital
adequacy guidelines. On and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. 
Securitization income, net
  Includes non-credit provision components of the net gains or losses from securitization activities;
changes in fair value of the interest-only strip; excess spread related to securitized cardmember loans; and servicing income, net of related discounts or fees. Excess spread, which is recognized as earned, is the net cash flow from interest and fee
collections allocated to the third-party investors interests in the securitization after deducting the interest paid on the investor certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees and other expenses. 
Stored value and prepaid products
  Includes Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products such as gift cheques and cards as well
as reloadable Travelers Cheque cards. These products are sold as safe and convenient alternatives to currency for purchasing goods and services. 
Tier 1 capital ratio
  Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common shareholders equity, certain perpetual
preferred stock, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for certain other comprehensive income items, ineligible goodwill and intangible assets. This ratio is commonly used by regulatory agencies to assess a financial
institutions financial strength and is the primary form of capital used to absorb losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. 
Tier 1 leverage ratio
  Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital (as defined above) by the Companys average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. 
62

2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
Total cards-in-force
  Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Total consumer cards-in-force includes basic
cards issued to the primary account owner and any supplemental cards, which represent additional cards issued on that account. Total small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic cards issued to employee cardmembers. Proprietary
cards-in-force represent card products where the Company owns the cardmember relationship, including card issuance, billing and credit management and strategic plans such as marketing, promotion, and development of card products and offerings.
Proprietary cards-in-force include co-brand and affinity cards. For non-proprietary cards-in-force (except for certain independent operator network partnership agreements), the Company maintains the responsibility to acquire and service merchants
that accept the Companys cards and the cardmember relationship is owned by the Companys network partners that issue the cards (who also provide the Company data on the number of cards they issue). 
Total risk-based capital ratio
  Total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital (as defined above) and
Tier 2 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. The Company calculates Tier 2 capital as the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and 45 percent of the unrealized gains on equity
securities. 
Travel sales  
Represents the total dollar amount of travel transaction volume for airline, hotel, car
rental, and other travel arrangements made for consumers and corporate clients. The Company earns revenue on these transactions by charging a transaction or management fee. 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This report includes forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address the Companys expected business and financial performance, among other matters,
contain words such as believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, may, should, could,
would, likely, and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to
update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: the Companys ability to exceed for 2010 its
on-average, over-time earnings per share growth target of 12 percent to 15 percent per annum, which will depend on, among other things, the factors described below, including the level of consumer and business spending, credit trends, expense
management, currency and interest rate fluctuations and general economic conditions, such as unemployment and GDP growth; the Companys ability to manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchants and other credit trends,
which will depend in part on (i) the economic environment, including, among other things, the housing market, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate
customers and businesses that accept the Companys card products, (ii) the effectiveness of the Companys credit models and (iii) the impact of recently enacted statutes and proposed legislative initiatives affecting the credit
card business, including, without limitation, The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act); the impact of the Companys efforts to deal with delinquent cardmembers in the current
challenging economic environment, which may affect payment patterns of cardmembers and the perception of the Companys services, products and brands; the Companys near-term write-off rates, including those for the first and second
quarters of 2010, which will depend in part on changes in the level of the Companys loan balances, delinquency rates of cardmembers, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans; consumer and
business spending on the Companys credit and charge card products and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the economic environment, and the ability to issue new and enhanced
card and prepaid products, services and rewards programs, and increase revenues from such products, attract new cardmembers, reduce cardmember attrition, capture a greater share of existing cardmembers spending, and sustain premium discount
rates on its card products in light of regulatory and market pressures, increase merchant coverage, retain cardmembers after low introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the Global Network Services business; the write-off and delinquency
rates in the medium- to long-term of cardmembers added by the Company during the past few years, which could impact their profitability to the Company; the Companys ability to effectively implement changes in the pricing of certain of its
products and services; fluctuations in interest rates (including fluctuations in benchmarks, such as LIBOR and other benchmark rates that may give rise to basis risk, and credit spreads), which impact the Companys borrowing costs, return on
lending products and the value of the Companys investments; the Companys net interest yield on cardmember loans trending downward over time closer to historical levels, which will be impacted by the affects of the CARD Act and changes in
consumer behavior that affect loan balances; the actual amount to be spent by the Company on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services based on managements assessment of competitive opportunities and other factors affecting its
judgment and during 2010, the extent of provision benefit, if any, from

lower than expected write-offs; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion expenses as business expands or changes, including the ability to accurately
estimate the provision for the cost of the Membership Rewards program; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the Companys ability to grow its business and generate excess capital and earnings in a manner and at levels that will
allow the Company to return a portion of capital to shareholders, which will depend on the Companys ability to manage its capital needs, and the effect of business mix, acquisitions and rating agency and regulatory requirements, including
those arising from the Companys status as a bank holding company; the ability of the Company to meet its objectives with respect to the growth of its brokered retail CD program, brokerage sweep account program and the direct deposit
initiative, which will depend in part on customer demand, the perception of the Companys brand and regulatory capital requirements; the success of the Global Network Services business in partnering with banks in the United States, which will
depend in part on the extent to which such business further enhances the Companys brand; allows the Company to leverage its significant processing scale, expands merchant coverage of the network, provides Global Network Services bank
partners in the United States the benefits of greater cardmember loyalty and higher spend per customer, and merchant benefits such as greater transaction volume and additional higher spending customers; the ability of the Global Network Services
business to meet the performance requirements called for by the Companys settlements with MasterCard and Visa; trends in travel and entertainment spending and the overall level of consumer confidence; the uncertainties associated with business
acquisitions, including, among others, the failure to realize anticipated business retention, growth and cost savings, as well as the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into the Companys existing operations; the success,
timeliness and financial impact (including costs, cost savings, and other benefits, including increased revenues), and beneficial effect on the Companys operating expense to revenue ratio, both in the short-term and over time, of reengineering
initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing (including, among others, technologies
operations), relocating certain functions to lower-cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions, including, the ability
of the Company to generate an annualized level of greater than $500 million of gross expense savings by 2012 from reengineering actions in its Global Services unit; the Companys ability to reinvest the benefits arising from such reengineering
actions in its businesses; bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations or similar events affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of the Companys billed business, including any potential negative effect
on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could result from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries; the triggering of obligations to make payments to certain co-brand partners,
merchants, vendors and customers under contractual arrangements with such parties under certain circumstances; a downturn in the Companys businesses and/or negative changes in the Companys and its subsidiaries credit ratings, which
could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; the ability of the Company to satisfy its liquidity needs and execute on its funding plans, which will depend on, among other things, the
Companys future business growth, its credit ratings, market capacity and demand for securities offered by the Company, performance by the Companys counterparties under its bank credit facilities and other lending facilities, regulatory
changes, including changes to the policies, rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Companys ability to securitize and sell receivables and the
performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions; accuracy of estimates for the fair value of the assets in the Companys investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable; the
ability of the Companys charge card and lending trusts to maintain excess spreads at levels sufficient to avoid material set-asides or early amortization of the Companys charge card and lending securitizations, which will depend on
various factors such as income derived from the relevant portfolios and their respective credit performances; the increase in excess spread resulting from the designation of discount option receivables with respect to the American Express Credit
Account Master Trust, which will depend in part on the monthly principal payment rate posted to accounts in, and the credit performance of, the securitized lending portfolio; the Companys ability to invest in technology advances across all
areas of its business to stay on the leading edge of technologies applicable to the payments industry; the Companys ability to attract and retain executive management and other key employees; the Companys ability to protect its
intellectual property rights (IP) and avoid infringing the IP of other parties; the potential negative effect on the Companys businesses and infrastructure, including information technology, of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, intrusion
into our infrastructure by hackers or other catastrophic events in the future; political or economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect lending and other commercial activities, among other businesses, or
restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies; changes in laws or government regulations; the administrations proposal to impose a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee at the rate of

approximately 15 basis points on certain liabilities of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions with consolidated assets of at least $50 billion; the potential failure of
the U.S. Congress to extend the active financing exception to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which could increase the Companys effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on net income; the potential impact of the CARD Act and
regulations adopted by federal bank regulators relating to certain credit and charge card practices, including, among others, the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect
of outstanding balances with different interest rates, which could have an adverse impact on the Companys net income; accounting changes, including the implementation of changes to the accounting for off-balance sheet activities or other
potential regulatory interpretations in this area, which, effective January 1, 2010, requires the Company to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the lending securitization trust, thereby requiring the Company to reestablish loss reserves,
which has in turn resulted in a reduction to the Companys regulatory capital ratios and will also result in a change with respect to the presentation of its financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2010, and which also could
result in lower credit ratings on securities issued by the Companys off-balance sheet securitization trusts as a result of the uncertainty with respect to the ability of rating agencies to continue to rely on the FDICs safe harbor rule
regarding the isolation of securitized assets in the event of a sponsoring banks receivership or conservatorship, which in turn could adversely impact the Companys ability to utilize securitizations as a component of its funding
strategy; outcomes and costs associated with litigation and compliance and regulatory matters; and competitive pressures in all of the Companys major businesses. A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in
the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and the Companys other reports filed with the SEC.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON 
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING 
The management of the Company
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
The Companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in the United
States of America, and includes those policies and procedures that: 
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the Company; 
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the Companys
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework. 
Based on managements assessment and those criteria, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2009, the Companys internal control
over financial reporting is effective. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an attestation report appearing on the following page on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of American Express Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based
on criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. The
Company has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through February 25, 2010, which is the date the financial statements were issued. 
The Company consolidates all voting interest entities in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest through which the Company is able to exercise control over those entities operating
and financial decisions. Entities in which the Companys voting interest does not provide the Company with control, but allows the Company to exert significant influence over their financial and operating decisions are accounted for under the
equity method. All other investments in equity securities, to the extent that they are not considered marketable securities, are accounted for under the cost method. 
Investments with variable interest entities (VIEs) are limited. The Company consolidates any VIEs for which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE
is based on the amount and characteristics of the entitys equity. An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE when it has a variable interest for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, that is, it will absorb a majority of the
VIEs expected losses or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns. 
Certain reclassifications of
prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of each year. The resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax
effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial
liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency, including
operations outside the U.S. where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported net, in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income, in other non-interest revenue, interest income, interest expense, or other, net expense,
depending on the nature of the activity. Net foreign currency transaction gains amounted to approximately $205 million, $15 million and $27 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 19 for further discussion of certain items
that impacted these gains in 2009. 
AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on managements assumptions
concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for cardmember losses relating to loans and charge card receivables, reserves for Membership Rewards cost, fair value measurements, goodwill and
income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. 
TOTAL
REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE 
Discount Revenue 
Discount revenue represents fees charged to merchants with which the Company, or its franchise partners, has entered into card acceptance agreements for facilitating transactions between the merchants and
the Companys cardmembers. The discount generally is deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the charge is captured. 
Net Card Fees 
Card fees are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the 12-month card membership period, net of deferred direct card acquisition costs and a reserve for projected membership cancellations. Charge card fees are recognized in net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the unamortized
net card fee balance is reported in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 11). Loan product fees are considered an enhancement to the

yield on the product, and are recognized in interest and fees on loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance for lending products is reported net in
cardmember loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 5). 
Travel Commissions and Fees 
The Company earns travel commissions and fees by charging clients transaction or management fees for selling and arranging travel and travel management
services. Client transaction fee revenue is recognized at the time the client books the travel arrangements. Travel management services revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the agreement. The Companys travel suppliers (for
example, airlines, hotels, car rental companies) pay commissions and fees on tickets issued, sales and other services based on contractual agreements. Commissions and fees from travel suppliers are generally recognized at the time a ticket is
purchased or over the term of the contract. Commissions and fees that are based on actual usage that is unknown at time of purchase (for example, hotel and car rentals) are recognized when cash is received. 
Other Commissions and Fees 
Other
commissions and fees include foreign currency conversion fees, delinquency fees, service fees and other card related assessments, which are recognized primarily in the period in which they are charged to the cardmember. Also included are fees
related to the Companys Membership Rewards program, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee. The unamortized Membership Rewards fee balance is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer
to Note 11). 
Contra-revenue 
The Company regularly makes payments through contractual arrangements with merchants, Commercial Card clients and certain other customers, collectively the customers. Payments to customers are generally classified as
contra-revenue unless a specifically identifiable benefit (e.g. goods or services) is received by the Company in consideration for that payment and the fair value of such benefit is determinable and measurable. If no such benefit is identified, then
the entire payment is classified as contra-revenue, and included within total non-interest revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item where the related transaction revenues are recorded (e.g. discount revenue, travel
commissions and fees, and other commissions and fees). If such a benefit is identified, then the payment is classified as expense up to the estimated fair value of the benefit. 
Interest Income 
Interest on loans owned is assessed using the average daily
balance method. Interest is recognized based upon the loan principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written-off. 
Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to the Companys performing fixed-income securities. Interest income
is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment securitys outstanding balance.
Amounts are recognized until such time as a security is in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. 
Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight
sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts. 
Interest Expense 
Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund cardmember loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity
needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into three categories (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, (ii) short-term borrowings,
which primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings, and (iii) long-term debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on the Companys long-term
financing. 
BALANCE SHEET 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank
balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. 
Premises and Equipment 
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets, which range from 3
to 8 years for equipment. Premises are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date, which generally ranges from 40 to 60 years. 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the economic life of the improvement, which ranges from 5 to 10 years.
The Company maintains operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment. Rent

expense for facility leases is recognized ratably over the lease term, and is calculated to include adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances. The
Company accounts for lease restoration obligations in accordance with applicable GAAP, which requires recognition of the fair value of restoration liabilities when incurred, and amortization of capitalized restoration costs over the lease term.

Software development costs 
The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended
use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the softwares estimated useful life, generally 5 years.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently issued the following accounting standards, which are effective beginning January 1, 2010.

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-16, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets: An amendment for
accounting for transfers of financial assets will eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), therefore requiring these entities to be evaluated under the accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs. Other changes include
additional considerations when determining if sale accounting is appropriate, as well as enhanced disclosure requirements. The new standard is to be applied prospectively to transactions completed after the effective date.

ASU No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities: An
amendment for accounting by enterprises involved with VIEs eliminates the scope exception for QSPEs and requires an entity to reconsider its previous consolidation conclusions reached under the VIE consolidation model, including (i) whether an
entity is a VIE, (ii) whether the enterprise is the VIEs primary beneficiary, and (iii) the required financial statement disclosures. The new standard can be applied as of the effective date, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to
retained earnings recognized on that date, or retrospectively, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized as of the beginning of the first year adjusted. 
The Company has determined that it will be required to consolidate the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) as a result of
implementing these standards. This will result in approximately $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans being recognized on the balance sheet of the Company effective January 1, 2010, along with $25.0 billion of long-term debt. This will
also result in the reduction of the Companys investment securities by $3.6 billion and other assets by $0.7 billion. The $29.0 billion of cardmember loans will require associated loan loss reserves of approximately $2.5 billion, which will be
charged directly against retained earnings. The adjustments described above will reduce shareholders equity by approximately $1.8 billion on an after-tax basis. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion of the Lending Trust. 
NOTE 2 
ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
ACQUISITIONS 
Revolution Money 
On
January 15, 2010, the Company purchased Revolution Money, a provider of secure person-to-person payment services through an internet based platform, for approximately $300 million. The majority of the consideration paid is expected to be
recorded as goodwill, with the remainder to be allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities. 
Corporate Payment Services 
On March 28, 2008, the Company purchased Corporate Payment Services (CPS), General Electric
Companys commercial card and corporate purchasing business unit. The Company acquired $2.2 billion in assets and assumed $63 million in liabilities. The total cash consideration of $2.3 billion paid by the Company consisted of the contractual
purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion plus the repayment of CPS $1.2 billion in outstanding debt as of the acquisition date. 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
On September 18, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its international banking
subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd. (AEB) to Standard Chartered PLC (Standard Chartered) and to sell American Express International Deposit Company (AEIDC) through a put/call agreement to Standard Chartered 18 months after the close of the AEB
sale. The sale of AEB was completed on February 29, 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, AEIDC qualified to be reported as a discontinued operation. The sale of AEIDC was completed on September 10, 2009. 
For all periods presented, all of the operating results, assets and liabilities, and cash flows of AEB (except for certain components of AEB
that were not sold) and AEIDC have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and are presented separately in discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.

NOTE 3 
FAIR VALUES 
As permitted under GAAP, the Company adopted new fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in two phases.
The first phase, effective for the Company January 1, 2008, establishes requirements for fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities, and other recurring fair value measurements reported or disclosed at fair value. The second
phase, effective for the Company January 1, 2009, establishes requirements for all other assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, and is based on the Companys principal or most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. 
GAAP established a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: 
Level 1  inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability, including: 
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets 
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
Level 3  inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Companys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g. internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). 
As summarized in the table below, the Company has financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For the year ended
December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any significant assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. 
The following table provides a summary of the estimated fair values for the
Companys financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by GAAPs valuation hierarchy (as described above), as of December 31:

VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN MEASURING 
FAIR VALUE 
GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of all financial instruments. A financial instrument
is defined as cash, evidence of an ownership in an entity, or a contract between two entities to deliver cash or another financial instrument or to exchange other financial instruments. The disclosure requirements for the fair value of financial
instruments exclude leases, equity method investments, affiliate investments, pension and benefit obligations, insurance contracts and all non-financial instruments. 
For the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, summarized in the valuation hierarchy table above, the Company applies the following valuation techniques to measure
fair value: 
Investment Securities (Excluding Retained Subordinated Securities and the Interest-only Strip) 
When available, quoted market prices in active markets are used to determine fair value. Such investment securities are classified within Level 1 of
the fair value hierarchy. 
When quoted prices in an active market are not available, the fair values for the Companys investment securities are obtained primarily from
pricing services engaged by the Company, and the Company receives one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated by using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market
inputs. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and
broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of
transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, the Company did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services.
The Company classifies the prices obtained from the pricing services within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the underlying inputs are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets.
However, the pricing models used do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value. 
The Company has reaffirmed its understanding of the valuation techniques used by its pricing services. In addition, the Company corroborates the prices
provided by its pricing services to test their reasonableness by comparing their prices to valuations from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities. Refer to Note 6 for additional fair
value information. 
Retained Subordinated Securities 
The Company determines the fair value of its retained subordinated securities using discounted cash flow models. The discount rate used is based on an interest rate curve that is observable in the
marketplace plus an unobservable credit spread commensurate with the risk of these securities and similar financial instruments. The Company classifies such securities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the applicable credit spreads are
not observable due to the illiquidity in the market with respect to these securities and similar financial instruments. Refer to Note 7 for additional fair value information. 
78 
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
Interest-only Strip 
The fair value of the interest-only strip is the present value of estimated future positive excess spread expected to be generated by the securitized loans over the estimated remaining life of those
loans. Management utilizes certain estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the interest-only strip asset, including estimates for finance charge yield, credit losses, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (which determines future
certificate interest costs), monthly payment rate and discount rate. On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the assumptions it uses in calculating the fair value of its interest-only strip to observable market data when available, and to
historical trends. The interest-only strip is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significance of the unobservable inputs used in valuing this asset. Refer to Note 7 for additional fair value information. 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments, which could be assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing
models, or by using internal pricing models, neither of which contain a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do not require significant judgment and inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets.
In each case, the valuation models used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period of maturity, and market-based parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or
prices, and volatility. 
Credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters (for example, a benchmark curve)
used to value derivatives are not indicative of the credit quality of the Company or its counterparties. The Company considers the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure. Refer to Note 12
for additional fair value information.

The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and perceived risks as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and require management judgment. These figures may not be indicative of their future fair
values. The fair value of the Company cannot be estimated by aggregating the amounts presented. 
The following methods were
used to determine estimated fair values: 
FINANCIAL ASSETS FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUES EQUAL OR APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE

Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include cash and cash equivalents, cardmember receivables, accrued
interest and certain other assets. For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short-term in duration or variable rate in nature. 
79 
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
FINANCIAL ASSETS CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE 
Loans 
Loans are recorded at
historical cost, less reserves, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair value for the Companys loans, the principal market is assumed to be the securitization market, and the Company uses the hypothetical securitization
price to determine the fair value of the portfolio. The securitization price is estimated from the assumed proceeds of the hypothetical securitization in the current market, adjusted for securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and
liquidity. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUES EQUAL OR APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE 
Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include accrued interest, customer deposits (excluding certificates of
deposit, which are described further below), Travelers Cheques outstanding, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities for which the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short-term in duration, variable rate in nature, or
have no defined maturity. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE 
Certificates of Deposit 
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the Companys current borrowing rates for
similar types of CDs. 
Long-term Debt 
Long-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using either quoted market prices or discounted cash flows based on the Companys
current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing. 
NOTE 4 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES 
Cardmember receivables represent amounts due from charge
card customers. These receivables are recorded at the time a cardmember enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant. Cardmember receivable balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for losses, discussed
below, and includes principal and any related accrued fees. 
RESERVES FOR LOSSES  CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES 
Reserves for losses relating to cardmember receivables represent managements best estimate of the losses inherent in the Companys outstanding
portfolio of receivables. Managements evaluation process requires certain estimates and judgments. Reserves for these losses are primarily based upon models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect managements judgment regarding
overall reserve adequacy. The analytic models take into account several factors, including average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. Management considers whether to adjust the analytic models for specific factors such as
increased risk in certain portfolios, impact of risk management initiatives on portfolio performance and concentration of credit risk based on factors such as tenure, industry or geographic regions. In addition, management adjusts the reserves for
losses for other external environmental factors such as leading economic and market indicators, and the legal and regulatory environment. Generally, due to the short-term nature of cardmember receivables, the impact of the other external
environmental factors on the inherent losses within the cardmember receivable portfolio is not significant. As part of this evaluation process, management also considers various reserve coverage metrics, such as reserves as a percentage of past-due
amounts, reserves as a percentage of cardmember receivables and net write-off coverage. 
Cardmember receivables balances are
written off when management deems amounts to be uncollectible and is generally determined by the number of days past due. Cardmember receivables within the U.S. Card Services (USCS) segment are generally written off when 180 days past due and
cardmember receivables within the International Card Services (ICS) and Global Commercial Services (GCS) segments are generally written off when 360 days past billing. Receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are written off upon
notification. Recoveries are recognized on a cash basis. 
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, cardmember receivables in the
USCS segment were written off when 360 days past billing. During 2008, consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance, the Company modified its write-off methodology to write off cardmember receivables in the USCS segment when 180 days past
due. Net cardmember

LOANS 
CARDMEMBER LOANS 
Cardmember loans represent amounts due from lending product customers. These loans are recorded at the time a cardmember enters into a point-of-sale
transaction with a merchant or when a charge card customer enters into an extended payment arrangement. Cardmember loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for cardmember losses, unamortized net card fees and include
accrued interest receivable and fees as of the balance sheet date. The Companys policy is to generally cease accruing for interest receivable on a cardmember loan at the time when the account is written off. 
RESERVES FOR LOSSES  CARDMEMBER LOANS 
Reserves for losses relating to cardmember loans represent managements best estimate of the losses inherent in the Companys outstanding portfolio of loans. Managements evaluation process
requires certain estimates and judgments. Reserves for these losses are primarily based upon models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect managements judgment regarding overall reserve adequacy. The analytic models take into account
several factors, including average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. Management considers whether to adjust the analytic models for specific factors such as increased risk in certain portfolios, impact of risk management
initiatives on portfolio performance and concentration of credit risk based on factors such as tenure, industry or geographic regions. In addition, management adjusts the reserves for losses for other external environmental factors including leading
economic and market indicators such as the unemployment rate, GDP, home price indices, non-farm payrolls, personal consumption expenditures index, consumer confidence index, purchasing managers index, bankruptcy filings and the legal and
regulatory environment. As part of this evaluation process, management also considers various reserve coverage metrics, such as reserves as a percentage of past-due amounts, reserves as a percentage of cardmember loans and net write-off coverage.

Cardmember loan balances are written off when management deems amounts to be uncollectible and is generally determined by the
number of days past due (at 180 days past due). Cardmember loans in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are written off upon notification. Recoveries are recognized on a cash basis.

securities. For December 31, 2008, these amounts include reclassification of waived fee reserves to contra-cardmember loans. This amount, for all periods, includes foreign currency
translation adjustments. 
PLEDGED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES 
Certain cardmember loans and receivables totaling approximately $16.3 billion are pledged by the Company to its securitization Trusts (refer to Note 7). Upon
adoption of new GAAP governing transfers of financial assets as of January 1, 2010, and the resulting consolidation of the Lending Trust (refer to Note 1), approximately $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans will be recognized on the
balance sheet of the Company. While the $29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans were sold by the Companys bank subsidiaries to the Lending Trust, such loans are deemed to be pledged by the Company to the Companys Lending Trust.

IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES 
Individually impaired loans and receivables are defined by GAAP as larger balance or smaller balance homogeneous restructured loans and receivables for which it is probable that the lender
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan and receivable agreement. The Company may modify cardmember loans and receivables and such modifications may include reducing the interest
rate/delinquency fees on the loans and receivables and/or placing the cardmember on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the cardmember does not comply with the modified terms, then the loan or receivable agreement reverts back to its
original terms. Impaired loans and receivables include long-term modification programs or Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR), wherein the terms of a loan or receivable have been modified for cardmembers that are experiencing financial difficulties
and a long-term concession (more than 12 months) has been granted to the borrower. TDRs totaled $114 million and $71 million of cardmember loans and receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Reserves for losses for
TDRs is determined by the difference between cash flows expected to be received from the cardmember discounted at the original contractual interest rates and the carrying value of the cardmember balance. 
The Companys policy is generally to accrue interest through the date of charge-off (i.e. 180 days past due). Loans amounting to $299
million and $927 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. These amounts include $46 million and $69 million of cardmember loans that are also included in the Short Term
Modification Programs discussed above. In addition, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, loans of $494 million and $14 million, respectively, were not accruing interest. These amounts primarily include certain cardmember loans placed with outside
collection agencies. 
OTHER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES WITH SHORT-TERM MODIFICATIONS 
In addition to the TDRs discussed above, the Company has instituted other modification programs that include short-term (12 months or less) interest rate and
fee reductions to cardmembers experiencing financial difficulty (Short Term Modification Programs). As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $701 million and $497 million, respectively, in cardmember loans and receivables have
been modified under these Short Term Modification Programs. These amounts include $46 million and $69 million, respectively, of cardmember loans that are also included in loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest discussed above. The
short-term modifications to these cardmember loans and receivables had no incremental impact on the Companys reserve for losses.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
Investment securities include debt and equity securities and are classified as available-for-sale. The
Companys investment securities, principally debt securities, are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of income tax provisions
(benefits). Realized gains and losses are recognized in results of operations upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method on a trade date basis. Refer to Note 3 for a description of the Companys methodology for
determining the fair value of its investment securities.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT 
Realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews and evaluates its investments
at least quarterly and more often, as market conditions may require, to identify investments that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. The determination of other-than-temporary impairment is a subjective process, requiring the use
of judgments and assumptions. It is reasonably possible that a change in estimate will occur in the near term relating to other-than- temporary impairment. Accordingly, the Company considers several factors when evaluating debt securities for an
other-than-temporary impairment including the determination of the extent to which the decline in fair value of the security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk. With respect to increased default
risk, the Company assesses the collectibility of principal and interest payments by monitoring issuers credit ratings, related changes to those ratings, specific credit events associated with the individual issuers as well as the credit
ratings of a financial guarantor, where applicable, and the extent to which amortized cost exceeds fair value and the duration and size of that difference. With respect to market interest rate risk, including benchmark interest rates and credit
spreads, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the securities, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of any unrealized losses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
The gross unrealized losses on state and municipal securities and all other debt securities are
attributable to a number of reasons such as issuer specific credit spreads and changes in market interest rates. 
In assessing
default risk on these securities, excluding the Companys retained subordinated securities, the Company has qualitatively considered the key factors identified above and determined that it expects to collect all of the contractual cash flows
due on the securities. In assessing default risk on the retained subordinated securities, the Company has analyzed the projected cash flows of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and expects to collect all of the
contractual cash flows due on the securities. 
Overall, for the investment securities in gross unrealized loss positions
identified above (a) the Company does not intend to sell the securities, (b) it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and (c) the Company expects
that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the securities.

The Companys individual investments in the unrated classes of its retained subordinated securities contain multiple maturity dates over periods ranging from 2010 through 2018. Accordingly, in the table above, the Company has
classified such investments based on the weighted-average maturity. In addition, the expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because borrowers have the
right to call or prepay certain obligations.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
NOTE 7 
ASSET SECURITIZATIONS 
The Company periodically securitizes cardmember receivables and loans arising from its card business
through the transfer of those assets to a trust. The trust then issues securities to third-party investors, collateralized by the transferred assets. Securitization transactions are accounted for as either sales or secured borrowings, based on the
structure of the transaction and the current GAAP requirements. Refer to Note 1 for a description of the changes in GAAP governing the accounting for transfers of financial assets, which will result in all securitization transactions being accounted
for as secured borrowings by the Company effective January 1, 2010. 
Based on GAAP in effect at December 31, 2009, in
order for a securitization of financial assets to be accounted for as a sale, the transferor must surrender control over those financial assets to the extent that the transferor receives consideration other than beneficial interests in the
transferred assets. 
Cardmember loans are transferred to the American Express Credit Account Master Trust, the Lending Trust,
which meets the criteria of a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), and such transactions qualify as accounting sales through year-end, 2009. Accordingly, when loans were sold through securitizations, the Company removed the loans from its
Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized a gain or loss on sale and retained interests in the securitizations. 
Cardmember
receivables are transferred to the American Express Issuance Trust, the Charge Trust, which is not a QSPE. Securitizations of cardmember receivables are accounted for as secured borrowings. 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET SECURITIZATIONS 
Servicing Portfolio 
In consideration for the transfer of the current cardmember loans, as well as the future cash flows
related to the cardmember account, the Company, through its subsidiaries, receives an undivided, pro rata interest in the trust referred to as sellers interest, which is equal to the balance of all cardmember loans ($36.2 billion and $40.5
billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) transferred to the Lending Trust plus the associated accrued interest receivable ($918 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) less the investors
portion of those assets (securitized cardmember loans). Sellers interest is reported as cardmember loans on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any accrued interest related to the investors portion of securitized cardmember
loans is reported as other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company retains servicing
responsibilities for the transferred cardmember loans through its subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), and earns a related fee. No servicing asset or liability is recognized at the time of a securitization
because the Company receives adequate compensation relative to current market servicing fees.

The Company announced in the second quarter of 2009 that certain actions affecting outstanding series of securities issued by the Lending Trust were completed in order to adjust the credit enhancement structure of substantially all of the
outstanding series of securities previously issued by the Lending Trust. These actions were to address the concerns of rating agencies and the decline in the trust excess spread due to the performance of the underlying credit card receivables in the
Lending Trust. The actions, which are permitted by the transaction documents governing the Lending Trust, consisted of the following: 
1.
Issuance of two new series of investor certificates (collectively, the Series D Certificates) equaling approximately $1.5 billion in aggregate. The Series D
Certificates were acquired by the Company in exchange for a portion of the sellers interest in the Lending Trust. The D Certificates, which were issued at a market interest rate, are subordinated to all other investor certificates and
therefore provide additional credit enhancement to all outstanding series. These certificates have various maturities, including a final maturity of 2018.

2.
Designation of a percentage of new principal receivables arising from accounts in the Lending Trust as Discount Option Receivables (as defined in the
Lending Trust documentation). As permitted under the terms of the transaction documents governing the Lending Trust, collections on Discount Option Receivables may be applied as finance charge collections, which increased the yield on the assets in
the Lending Trust by approximately 400-650 basis points beginning with the July 2009 monthly reporting period. The designation of Discount Option Receivables is scheduled to continue through 2010. 
The actions described above did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations.

and collected by the Company on new transactions by cardmembers that have their loans sold into the Lending Trust. These cash flows are available to pay monthly Lending Trust expenses. The issuer rate is reported in discount revenue in the
Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. In periods when the excess spread, net in the Lending Trust becomes negative, and the issuer rate fee collections are utilized to pay Lending Trust expenses, the Company recognizes an expense in

Excludes $201 million and $(393) million of credit provision impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities for 2009, $446 million and $(177) million of credit
provision impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities for 2008, as well as $144 million and $(84) million of credit provision impact from cardmember loan sales and maturities for 2007. 
At the time of a cardmember loan securitization, the Company records a gain (loss) on sale, which is calculated as the difference between the proceeds from
the sale and the book basis of the cardmember loans sold. The book basis is determined by allocating the carrying amount of the sold cardmember loans, net of applicable credit reserves, between the cardmember loans sold and the interests retained
based on their relative fair values. Such fair values are based on market prices at the date of transfer for the sold cardmember loans and on the estimated present value of future cash flows for retained interests. Gains (losses) on sale from
securitizations are reported in securitization income, net in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. The income component resulting from the release of credit reserves upon sale of cardmember loans is reported as a reduction of
provision for losses from cardmember loans. The removal of credit reserves in connection with retained subordinated securities is offset in the allocated cost of the associated retained subordinated securities. 
Retained Interests in Securitized Assets and Fair Value Measurement 
The Company retains subordinated interests in the securitized cardmember loans. These interests include one or more A-rated, BBB-rated and unrated investments in tranches of the securitization
(subordinated securities) and an interest-only strip. The following table presents retained interests for the years ended December 31:

Changes in the estimates and assumptions used may have a significant impact on the Companys valuation of the retained interests. The key
economic assumptions used in measuring the interest-only strip asset at the time of issuance as well as at December 31, 2009, and the sensitivity of the fair value to immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse changes in these assumptions are
as follows (rates are per annum):

The impact on fair value of a 20 percent adverse change is approximately two times the impact of a 10 percent adverse change identified above. 
(b)
The fair value of the interest-only strip is $20 million as of December 31, 2009. Therefore, a 10 percent adverse change in the assumption would result in the fair
value of the interest-only strip written down to zero. 
The key assumptions and the sensitivity of the current years fair
value of the retained subordinated securities to immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse changes in these key assumptions are as follows:

This sensitivity analysis does not represent managements expectations of adverse changes in these assumptions but is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the fair value of the retained subordinated
interests to changes in key inputs. Management cannot extrapolate changes in fair value based on a 10 percent or 20 percent change in all key assumptions simultaneously in part because the relationship of the change in one assumption on the fair
value of the retained interest is calculated independently from any change in another assumption. Changes in one factor may cause changes in another, which could magnify or offset the sensitivities.

considered a variable interest entity and is consolidated by American Express Receivables Financing Corporation V, LLC, its primary beneficiary, which is in turn consolidated by the Company.

The cardmember receivables securitized through this entity are not accounted for as sold and continue to be reported as owned
assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These receivables are available only for payment of the debt or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions. For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because these are short-term in duration.
The long-term debt is payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets. The fair value of these liabilities was $5.0 billion and $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
LENDING TRUST AND CHARGE TRUST TRIGGERS 
Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain events could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of

(a)
The excess spread rate, net including issuer rate collections in the Lending Trust is the sum of the net cash flows of the (i) excess spread, net and
(ii) issuer rate, as a percentage of the outstanding investors certificates. Excess spread, net is the net cash flows from interest and fee collections allocated to the investors interests after deducting the interest paid on
investors certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees and other expenses. The deductions may be a greater amount than the collections, resulting in negative spread losses. Excess spread, net is reported by the Company in
securitization income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See above for the disclosure of excess spread, net. 
(b)
The excess spread rate, net in the Charge Trust is the net cash flows from the discounted portion of principal collections allocated to the investors interests
after deducting the interest paid on investors notes, credit losses, contractual servicing fees and other expenses, as a percentage of the outstanding investors notes. 
(c)
If the three-month average excess spread rate, net including issuer rate collections falls below the trigger level of 5 percent or 4 percent for the Lending Trust and
Charge Trust, respectively, the affected Trust is required to fund a cash account in increasing amounts ($3 million to $1.7 billion for the Lending Trust and $11 million to $170 million for the Charge Trust) depending on the severity by which the
excess spread rate, net falls below the trigger level. 
In the event of an early amortization of the Lending Trust, the investor
certificates would be required to be repaid over an approximate four month period, based on the estimated average life of the securitized loans. Although the repayment of the investor certificates is non-recourse to the Company, the Company would
need an alternate source of funding for the lending receivables assets. 
In the event of an early amortization of the Charge
Trust, the underlying investor notes issued by the Charge Trust are required to be repaid over an approximate one month period, based on the estimated average life of the securitized receivable.

the future. 
GOODWILL 
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company assigns goodwill to its reporting units for the
purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business one level below an operating segment for which complete, discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews. The Company
evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting units below their carrying amounts. The goodwill impairment
test utilizes a two-step approach. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss. Goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. 
Goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be
supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earnings multiples or transaction multiples) or income approach (discounted cash flow methods). The fair values of
the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach. 
When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company uses internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. Actual results may
differ from forecasted results. The Company uses the expected cost of equity financing, estimated using a capital asset pricing model, to discount future cash flows for each reporting unit. The Company believes the discount rates used appropriately
reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in the Companys internally developed forecasts. Further, to assess the reasonableness of the valuations derived from the discounted cash flow models, the
Company also analyzes market based multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit, where available. 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill reported in the Companys reportable operating segments were as follows. During 2009 and 2008, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, the Company performs an impairment evaluation of all intangible assets by assessing the recoverability of the asset values based on the cash flows generated by the relevant assets or asset groups. An
impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the assets fair value.

interest rate swaps and are marked to market, as are the associated swaps, which are reported as derivative assets or liabilities. In 2009 and 2008, the impact on long-term debt due to fair value hedge accounting was $0.6 billion and $1.0 billion,
respectively. Refer to Note 12 for more details on the Companys treatment of fair value hedges. 
(b)
For floating rate debt issuances, the stated and effective interest rates are based on the floating rates in effect as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
These rates may not be indicative of future interest rates. 
(c)
Effective interest rates are only presented when swaps are in place to hedge the underlying debt. 
(d)
The maturity date will automatically be extended to September 1, 2066, except in the case of either (i) a prior redemption or (ii) a default. See further
discussion below.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
As of December 31, 2009, the Parent Company had $750 million principal outstanding of Subordinated Debentures that accrue interest at an
annual rate of 6.80 percent until September 1, 2016, and at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.23 percent thereafter. At the Companys option, the Subordinated Debentures are redeemable for cash after September 1, 2016 at 100
percent of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest. If the Company fails to achieve specified performance measures, it will be required to issue its common shares and apply the net proceeds to make interest payments on the
Subordinated Debentures. No dividends on the Companys common or preferred shares could be paid until such interest payments are made. The Company would fail to meet these specific performance measures if (i) the Companys tangible
common equity is less than 4 percent of total adjusted assets for the most recent quarter or (ii) if the trailing two quarters consolidated net income is equal to or less than zero and tangible common equity as of the trigger
determination date, and as of the end of the quarter end six months prior, has in each case declined by 10 percent or more from the tangible common equity as of the end of the quarter 18 months prior to the trigger determination date. The Company
met the specified performance measures in 2009. 
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company was not in violation of any
of its debt covenants.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company maintained total bank lines of credit of $12.2 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively. Of the total
credit lines, $9.0 billion and $8.7 billion were unutilized, and for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Company paid $6.8 million and $6.0 million in fees to maintain these lines. $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion of
these unutilized amounts supported commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
The
availability of these credit lines is subject to the Companys compliance with certain financial covenants, including the maintenance by the Company of consolidated tangible net worth of at least $4.1 billion, the maintenance by American
Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a 1.25 ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges, and the compliance by American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB) with applicable regulatory
capital adequacy guidelines. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys consolidated tangible net worth was approximately $11.6 billion, Credcos ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges was 1.59 and Centurion Bank
and FSB each exceeded their regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. 
The committed bank credit facilities do not contain
material adverse change clauses and the facilities may not be terminated should there be a change in the Companys credit rating. 
The Company paid total interest primarily related to short- and long-term debt, corresponding interest rate swaps and customer deposits of $2.3 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Membership Rewards 
The Membership Rewards program allows enrolled cardmembers to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards, including travel, entertainment, retail certificates, and merchandise. The
Company establishes balance sheet liabilities which represent the estimated cost of points earned to date that are ultimately expected to be redeemed. These liabilities reflect managements best estimate of future redemption costs. An ultimate
redemption rate and weighted average cost per point are key factors used to approximate the Membership Reward liability. Management uses models to estimate ultimate redemption rates based on historical redemption data, card product type, year of
program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. The weighted-average cost per point is determined using actual redemptions during the previous 12 months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs. 
The provision for the cost of Membership Rewards points is included in marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services. The Company
continually evaluates its reserve methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, contract changes, and other factors. 
DEFERRED CHARGE CARD FEES

NOTE 12 
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to various market
risks. Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. The Companys market risk exposure is primarily generated by: 
Interest rate risk in its card and insurance and travelers cheque businesses, and its investment portfolios; and 
Foreign exchange risk in its international operations. 
General principles and the overall framework for managing market risk across the Company are defined in the Market Risk Policy, which is the responsibility of the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO). Market
risk limits and escalation triggers in that policy are approved by the ALCO and by the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC). Market risk is centrally managed by the Market Risk Committee, which reports into the ALCO and is chaired by the
Chief Market Risk Officer of the Company. Market risk management is also guided by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding and liquidity and investments. Derivative financial instruments derive their value from an
underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity indices or prices. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an
integral component of the Companys market risk management. 
The Companys market exposures are in large part
by-products of the delivery of its products and services. Interest rate risk arises through the funding of cardmember receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in
the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR. 
Interest rate exposure within the Companys charge card
and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to
effectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate or to convert variable-rate debt to fixed rate. The Company may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors. The
majority of its cardmember loans, which are linked to a benchmark rate such as Prime that can reprice monthly, are funded with variable-rate funding, the majority of which are linked to LIBOR. 
Foreign exchange risk is generated by cardmember cross-currency charges, foreign currency balance sheet exposures, translation of foreign
subsidiary equity, and foreign currency earnings in international units. The Companys foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the
extent it is economically justified through various means, including the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward, options, and cross-currency swap contracts, which can help lock in the value of the
Companys exposure to specific currencies. The Company does not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments may contain counterparty credit risk. The Company manages this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum
potential value of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as investment
grade. Counterparty risk exposures are monitored by the Companys Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC). The IRMC formally reviews large institutional exposures to ensure compliance with the Companys ERMC guidelines and
procedures and determines the risk mitigation actions, when necessary. Additionally, to mitigate counterparty credit risk the Company may, on occasion, enter into master netting agreements. 
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the counterparty credit risk associated with the Companys derivative financial instruments was
not significant. In relation to the Companys credit risk, under the terms of its derivative financial instruments, the Company is not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balances, or post collateral upon the
occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in
fair value depends on the instruments intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below. Refer to Note 3 for a description of the Companys methodology for determining the fair value of its derivative
financial instruments. The following table summarizes the total gross fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative product assets and liabilities as of December 31:

GAAP permits the netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Company and its
derivative counterparty. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, $33 million and $39 million, respectively, of derivative assets and liabilities have been offset and presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING

Derivative financial instruments executed for hedge accounting purposes are documented and designated as such when the Company enters into the
contracts. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company structures its hedges with very similar terms to the hedged items. The Company formally assesses, at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on a quarterly basis,
whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. These assessments usually are made through the application of the regression analysis method. If it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, the Company will discontinue the application of hedge accounting. 
FAIR VALUE
HEDGES 
A fair value hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge the Companys exposure to future changes in the fair value of an
asset or a liability, or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its fixed-rate long-term debt. The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert certain
fixed-rate long-term debt to floating-rate at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company hedged $15.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, of its fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt using interest rate swaps.

To the extent the fair value hedge is effective, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item is referred to as hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in earnings as a component of other, net expenses. Hedge
ineffectiveness may be caused by differences between the debts interest coupon and the benchmark rate, which is in turn primarily due to credit spreads at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the valuation of the
interest rate swap. Furthermore, hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by changes in the relationship between 3-month LIBOR and 1-month LIBOR rates, as these so-called basis spreads may impact the valuation of the interest rate swap without causing an
offsetting impact in the value of the hedged debt. If a fair value hedge is de-designated or no longer considered to be effective, changes in fair value of the 
99 
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 

derivative continue to be recorded through earnings but the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value. The existing basis adjustment of the hedged asset or
liability is then amortized or accreted as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of that asset or liability.

CASH FLOW HEDGES 
A cash flow hedge
involves a derivative financial instrument designated to hedge the Companys exposure to variable future cash flows attributable to a particular risk of an existing recognized asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction. The Company hedges
existing long-term variable-rate debt, the rollover of short-term borrowings and the anticipated forecasted issuance of additional funding through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These instruments
effectively convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt for the duration of the swap. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company hedged $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, of its floating debt using interest rate swaps.

For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged cash flows are recognized in earnings. The amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income with the hedged
instrument or transaction impact, primarily in interest expense. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of other, net expenses. If a cash flow hedge is de-designated or terminated prior to maturity,
the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is recognized into earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings. If a hedge relationship is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted
transaction will not occur according to the original strategy, any related amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income are recognized into earnings immediately. 
In the normal course of business, as the hedged cash flows are recognized into earnings, the Company expects to reclassify $32 million of net
pretax losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into earnings during the next 12 months. 
NET INVESTMENT HEDGES 
A net investment hedge is used to hedge future changes in currency exposure of a net investment in a
foreign operation. The Company primarily designates foreign currency derivatives, typically foreign exchange forwards, and on occasion foreign currency denominated debt, as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. These instruments
reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on the Companys investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The effective portion of the gain or loss on net investment hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as
part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on net investment hedges is recognized in other, net expenses during the period of change.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

The Company has derivative financial instruments that act as economic hedges and are not designated for hedge accounting purposes. Foreign
currency transactions and non-U.S. dollar cash flow exposures from time to time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps. These hedges
generally mature within one year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of a designated currency at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives effectively offset the
related foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying balance sheet exposures. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps to specifically manage funding costs related to its proprietary card business. 
The Company has certain operating agreements whose payments may be linked to a market rate or price, primarily foreign currency rates. The
payment components of these agreements may meet the definition of an embedded derivative, which is assessed to determine if it requires separate accounting and reporting. If so, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately and is classified
as a foreign exchange contract based on its primary risk exposure. In addition, the Company also holds an investment security containing an embedded equity-linked derivative. 
For derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings.

GUARANTEES 
The Company provides cardmember protection plans that cover losses
associated with purchased products, as well as certain other guarantees in the ordinary course of business which are within the scope of GAAP governing the accounting for guarantees. For the Company, guarantees primarily consist of card and travel
protection programs, including: 
Credit Card Registry  cancels and requests replacement of lost or stolen cards, and provides for fraud liability coverage;

Return Protection  refunds the price of eligible purchases made with the card where the merchant will not accept the return for up to 90 days
from the date of purchase; 
Account Protection  provides account protection in the event that a cardmember is unable to make payments on the account due to unforeseen
hardship; and, 
Merchant Protection  protects cardmembers primarily against non-delivery of goods and services, usually in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation
of a merchant. In the event that a dispute is resolved in the cardmembers favor, the Company will credit the cardmember account for the amount of the purchase and will seek recovery from the merchant. If the Company is unable to collect the
amount from the merchant, it will bear the loss for the amount credited to the cardmember. The Company mitigates this risk by withholding settlement from the merchant or obtaining deposits and other guarantees from merchants considered higher risk
due to various factors. The amounts being held by the Company are not significant when compared to the maximum potential amount of future payments under this guarantee. 
In relation to its maximum amount of undiscounted future payments as seen in the table that follows, to date the Company has
not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees. The Companys initial recognition of guarantees is at fair value, which has been determined in accordance with GAAP governing fair value measurement. In addition, the Company
establishes reserves when an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

(a)
Of the common shares authorized but unissued as of December 31, 2009, approximately 124 million shares were reserved for issuance under employee stock and
employee benefit plans. 
The Board of Directors is
authorized to permit the Company to issue up to 20 million preferred shares at a par value of $1.66 2/3 without further shareholder approval. 
On January 9, 2009, under the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), the Company issued to the Treasury Department as consideration for
aggregate proceeds of $3.39 billion: (1) 3.39 million shares of Fixed Rate (5 percent) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares Series A (the Preferred Shares), and (2) a ten-year warrant (the Warrant) for the
Treasury Department to purchase up to 24 million common shares at an exercise price of $20.95 per share. Upon issuance, $3.16 billion of the proceeds were allocated to the Preferred Shares, and $232 million of the proceeds were
allocated to the Warrant based on their relative fair values at the date of issuance. 
As a pre-condition of the repurchase of
the Preferred Shares, the Treasury Department and the Companys Banking Regulator required that the Company raise capital in the public markets. As a result, the Company issued $3.0 billion of non-guaranteed senior debt on May 18, 2009 and
approximately 22 million common shares at $25.25 per share in June 2009. 
On June 17, 2009, the Company repurchased
the Preferred Shares at their face value of $3.39 billion. Because the $3.39 billion cash paid exceeded the $3.18 billion amortized carrying amount of the Preferred Shares, the $212 million excess represented an in-substance
Preferred Share dividend that reduced earnings per share (EPS) attributable to common shareholders by $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Refer to Note 18. 
On July 29, 2009, the Company repurchased the Warrant for $340 million. The Warrant repurchase resulted in reductions of cash,
retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Warrant repurchase had no impact on the Consolidated Income Statement and EPS for the year ended December 31, 2009. There were no preferred
shares or warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2009.

NOTE 16 
RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 
During 2009, the Company recorded $185 million of restructuring charges, net of adjustments of
previously accrued amounts due to revisions of prior estimates. The 2009 activity primarily relates to the $199 million of restructuring charges the Company recorded in the second quarter to further reduce its operating costs by downsizing and
reorganizing certain operations. These restructuring activities were for the elimination of approximately 4,000 positions or about 6 percent of the Companys total worldwide workforce and occurred across all business units, markets and staff
groups. Additional restructuring charges of $38 million taken in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 relate principally to the reorganization of certain senior leadership positions, as well as the exit of a business in the Global
Network & Merchant Services (GNMS) segment. The Company also recorded adjustments of $(52) million during 2009 that primarily relate to revisions of prior estimates for higher employee redeployments to other positions within the Company,
business changes and modifications to existing initiatives. These modifications do not constitute a significant change in the original restructuring plan from an overall Company perspective. 
During 2008, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $434 million, net of adjustments of previously accrued amounts due to revisions of
prior estimates. While the Companys restructuring activity in the first and third quarters of 2008 primarily related to exiting certain international banking businesses, the Company recorded $410 million of restructuring charges in the fourth
quarter of 2008 in order to further reduce the Companys cost structure. This restructuring was for the elimination of approximately 7,000 positions or approximately 10 percent of its total worldwide workforce. These reductions primarily
occurred across business units, markets and staff groups focusing on management and other positions that do not interact directly with customers, and related to reorganizing or automating certain internal processes; outsourcing certain operations to
third parties; and discontinuing or relocating business activities to other locations. During 2007, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $49 million, net of adjustments of previously accrued amounts due to revisions of prior estimates,
primarily related to the reorganizations within the Companys business travel, operations, finance, and technology areas. 
Restructuring charges related to severance obligations are included in salaries and employee benefits and discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income, while charges pertaining to other exit costs are
included in occupancy and equipment, professional services, other, net expenses and discontinued operations.

The Company records a deferred income tax (benefit) provision when there are differences between assets and
liabilities measured for financial reporting and for income tax return purposes. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such
differences are expected to reverse. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are reflected in the following table:

A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances as of December 31, 2009
and 2008 are associated with non-U.S. operations and relate to all of the Companys net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. 
Accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which totaled approximately $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2009, are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. The
Company does not provide for federal income taxes on foreign earnings intended to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Accordingly, federal taxes, which would have aggregated approximately $1.8 billion as of December 31,
2009, have not been provided on those earnings. 
Net income taxes paid by the Company (including amounts related to
discontinued operations) during 2009, 2008 and 2007, were approximately $0.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. These amounts include estimated tax payments and cash settlements relating to prior tax years.

Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
The Company, its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries, and certain non-U.S. subsidiaries file
a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex, and the
manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent complexities, the Company must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on managements judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on managements best judgment of the most likely outcome resulting from examination given the facts, circumstances and information available
at the reporting date. The Company adjusts the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome. 
The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years
under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. In June 2008, the IRS completed its field examination of the Companys federal tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002. In July 2009, the IRS completed its field
examination of the Companys federal tax returns for the years 2003 and 2004. However, all of these years continue to remain open as a consequence of certain issues under appeal. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the
years 2005 through 2007.

Included in the $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are
approximately $480 million, $452 million and $597 million, respectively that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in a future period. These benefits primarily relate to the Companys gross permanent benefits and
corresponding foreign tax credits and federal tax effects.
The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized
tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $580 million principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years tax items include
unrecognized tax benefits relating to the timing of recognition of certain gross income, the deductibility of certain expenses or losses, and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $580 million of
unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $318 million are temporary differences that, if recognized, would only impact the effective rate due to net interest assessments and state tax rate differentials. With respect to the remaining decrease of
$262 million, it is not possible to quantify the impact that the decrease could have on the effective tax rate and net income due to the inherent complexities and the number of tax years open for examination in multiple
jurisdictions. Resolution of the prior years items that comprise this remaining amount could have an impact on the effective tax rate and on net income, either favorably (principally as a result of settlements that are less than the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits) or unfavorably (if such settlements exceed the liability for unrecognized tax benefits). 
Interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in income tax provision. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized approximately $1 million, $60 million and $17 million,
respectively, of interest and penalties. The Company has approximately $282 million and $285 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

preferred shares on June 17, 2009 issued as part of the CPP. Also includes $74 million of preferred dividends paid and $20 million of preferred dividend accretion during 2009. 
(b)
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes 71 million, 45 million and 8 million
options, respectively, from the computation of EPS because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. 
(c)
Effective January 1, 2009, guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities requires that
restricted stock awards be included in the computation of basic and diluted EPS pursuant to the two-class method. Accordingly, the Company has retrospectively adjusted EPS for 2008 and 2007. 
The Subordinated Debentures, discussed in Note 10, would affect the EPS computation only in the unlikely event the Company fails to achieve specified
performance measures related to the Companys tangible common equity and consolidated net income. In that circumstance the Company would reflect the additional common shares in the EPS computation.

translation adjustments associated with a net investment in foreign subsidiaries (the impact of the incorrect accounting was not material to any of the quarterly or annual periods in which it occurred and resulted in a $60 million overstatement of
pretax income in the second quarter of 2009, a $135 million understatement of pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2008 and minimal amounts for all other periods affected dating back to the third quarter of 2007 when the incorrect accounting
originated), (ii) a $45 million benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2009 resulting from the change in fair value of certain forward exchange contracts, and (iii) lower travel and entertainment and other expenses due to the
Companys reengineering activities. Also includes a $59 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2009 representing the correction of an error related to prior periods from the completion of certain account reconciliations. Based on the
items described above, the aggregate impact from the correction of errors in accounting for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 resulted in a $254 million overstatement of pretax income. 
Other, net expense includes general operating expenses, gains (losses) on sale of assets or businesses not classified as discontinued operations, and

STOCK OPTIONS 
Each stock option has an exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and a contractual term of 10 years from the date of grant. Stock options generally
vest 25 percent per year beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. 
The weighted-average remaining
contractual life and the aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the fair value of the Companys stock exceeds the exercise price of the option) of the stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest as of
December 31, 2009 were as follows:

The intrinsic value for options exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $11 million, $79 million and $463 million, respectively (based upon the fair value of the Companys stock price at the date of exercise). Cash received from the
exercise of stock options in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $83 million, $176 million and $852 million, respectively. The tax benefit realized from income tax deductions from stock option exercises, which was recorded in additional paid-in capital, in
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $2 million, $21 million and $158 million, respectively. 
The fair value of each option is estimated on
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions are used for grants issued in 2009, 2008 and 2007, the majority of which were granted in the beginning of each year:

The expected volatility is based on weighted historical and implied volatilities of the Companys common stock price. The expected life of the options is based on historical data. 
STOCK OPTIONS WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED AND MARKET-BASED CONDITIONS

On November 30, 2007 and January 31, 2008, the Companys CEO was granted in the aggregate 2,750,000 of non-qualified stock
option awards with performance-based and market-based conditions. The exercise prices per share are $58.98 and $49.13, respectively. Both awards have a contractual term of 10 years and a vesting period of 6 years. 
Performance-based Conditions 
Awards for 2,062,500 options have performance-based conditions with an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $33.8 million using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Compensation expense for these awards will be
recognized over the vesting period when it is determined it is probable that the performance metrics will be achieved. No compensation expense for these awards was recorded in 2009, 2008 or 2007. 
Market-based Conditions 
Awards
for 687,500 options have market-based conditions with an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $10.5 million using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The expected volatility is based on historical returns of the Companys common stock
price and the S&P 500 Index. The expected life of the options is based on historical data. Compensation expense for the fair value of these awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period irrespective of the probability of the market metric
being achieved. Total compensation expense recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $2.4 million, $2.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. 
RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS 
RSAs are valued based on the stock price on the date of grant and vest generally 25 percent per year,
beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. RSA holders receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents. The total fair value of shares vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $44 million, $134 million and $203 million,
respectively (based upon the Companys stock price at the vesting date). 
The weighted-average grant date fair value of
RSAs granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007, is $18.04, $48.29 and $57.89, respectively. 
PORTFOLIO GRANTS 
In 2009, the Company awarded cash-settled PGs to Executive Officers that earn value based on the Companys financial performance and the Companys
total shareholder return versus the S&P 500 Index. Awards in 2009 for all other PG recipients earn value based on the Companys performance against financial and corporate objectives. The 2009 awards vest fifty percent each year over two
one-year performance periods. All PGs awarded in 2008 and 2007 earn value based on the Companys financial performance and the Companys

total shareholder return versus the S&P 500 Index and cliff vest after a three-year performance period. PG payouts are subject to CBC approval. 
The PGs are classified as liabilities and, therefore, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and remeasured quarterly as part of
compensation expense over the performance period. Cash paid upon vesting of PGs was $43 million, $59 million and $55 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS 
The
Companys significant defined benefit pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Most employees outside the United States and United Kingdom are covered by local retirement plans, some of which are funded,
while other employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. The Company complies with the minimum funding requirements in all countries. 
The Company sponsors the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan (the Plan) for eligible employees in the United States. The Plan is a
noncontributory defined benefit plan and a tax-qualified retirement plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). Effective July 1, 2007, the Plan was closed to new entrants and existing participants
no longer accrue future benefits. The Company funds retirement costs through a trust and complies with the applicable minimum funding requirements specified by ERISA, as revised under the Pension Protection Act (PPA), effective October 1, 2008.
The funded status of the Plan on an ERISA basis as of October 1, 2009 (applicable plan year) is 106 percent. The PPA calculation assumptions are specific to ERISA and differ from the calculation of the net funded status for GAAP purposes (see
Net Funded Status as of December 31, 2009 in the table below). 
The Plan is a cash balance plan and employees
accrued benefits are based on notional account balances, which are maintained for each individual. Employees balances are credited daily with interest at a fixed-rate that is updated each January 1 and is based on the average of the daily
five-year U.S. Treasury Note yields for the previous October 1 through November 30. The interest rate varies from a minimum of 5 percent to a maximum equal to the lesser of (i) 10 percent or (ii) the applicable interest rate set
forth in the Plan. Employees and their beneficiaries have the option to receive annuity payments upon retirement or a lump-sum payout at vested termination, death, disability or retirement. 
The Company also sponsors an unfunded non-qualified Supplemental Retirement Plan (the SRP) for employees compensated above a certain level to
supplement their pension benefits that are limited by the Internal Revenue Code. The SRP was also amended as of July 1, 2007, and its terms generally parallel those of the Plan, except that the definition of compensation and payment options
differ. 
For each plan, the net funded status is defined by GAAP governing retirement benefits as the difference between the
fair value of plan assets and the respective plans projected benefit obligation. The projected benefit obligation represents a liability based on the plan participants service-to-date and their expected future compensation at their
projected retirement date. Changes in the funded status are recorded as unamortized gains and losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the periods in which they occur along with prior service cost.

Discount rates
5.3
5.9
Rates of increase in compensation levels

Rates of increase in compensation levels

Expected long-term rates of return on assets
6.9

7.8
The Company assumes a long-term rate of return on assets on a weighted-average basis. In developing this assumption, management evaluates historical returns on plan assets as well as benchmark information including projections of asset
class returns and long-term inflation. 
The discount rate assumptions for the Companys significant defined benefit plans
are determined using a model consisting of bond portfolios that match the cash flows of the plans projected benefit payments based on the plan participants service to date and their expected future compensation. Use of the rate produced
by this model generates a projected benefit obligation that equals the current market value of a portfolio of high-quality zero-coupon bonds whose maturity dates and amounts match the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments.

Asset Allocation and Fair Value 
The Benefit Plans Investment Committee (BPIC) is appointed by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Companys Board of Directors and has the responsibility of reviewing and approving the
investment policies related to plan assets for the Companys defined benefit pension plans; evaluating the performance of the investments in accordance with the investment policy; reviewing the investment objectives, risk, characteristics,
expenses and historical performance; and selecting and evaluating the investment managers. The BPIC typically meets quarterly to review the performance of the various investment managers and service providers as well as other investment related
matters. The Companys significant defined benefit pension plans have investment policies, which prescribe targets for the amount of assets that can be invested in a security class in order to mitigate the detrimental impact of adverse or
unexpected results with respect to any individual security class on the overall portfolio. The portfolios are diversified by asset type, risk characteristics and concentration of investments. 
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new GAAP fair value disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension plan assets (the
new expanded disclosures are not applicable for plan assets at December 31, 2008 when the asset allocation was 48 percent equity securities, 43 percent fixed income securities, and 9 percent other investments). Refer to Note 3 for a discussion
related to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, including a description of the three-level fair value hierarchy of inputs.

CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS 
The Company sponsors defined contribution retirement plans, the principal plan being the Retirement Savings Plan
(RSP), a 401(k) savings plan with a profit sharing component. The RSP is a tax-qualified retirement plan subject to ERISA and covers most employees in the U. S. Under the terms of the RSP, employees have the option of investing up to 10 percent of
their contributions in the American Express Company Stock Fund, which invests primarily in the Companys common stock, through accumulated payroll deductions. Employees are restricted from transferring balances into this fund if the balance has
reached 10 percent of the employees total account balance. The RSP held 13 million shares of American Express Common Stock at both December 31, 2009 and 2008, beneficially for employees. Effective July 1, 2007, the Company
matches employee contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 5 percent of total pay. Additional annual conversion contributions of up to 8 percent of total pay are provided into the RSP for eligible employees who were hired before April 1,
2007. The Company also sponsors an RSP SRP, which is an unfunded non-qualified plan for employees whose RSP benefits are limited by the Internal Revenue Code and its terms generally parallel those of the RSP, except that the definition of
compensation and payment options differ. 
The total expense for all defined contribution retirement plans globally was $118
million, $211 million and $173 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in defined contribution expense in 2009 primarily reflects the Companys temporary suspension of the employer match conversion contributions (reinstated
prospectively in January 2010). 
OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
The Company sponsors unfunded other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance to certain retired U.S. employees.

ASSUMPTIONS 
The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were: 
2009
2008
Discount rates
5.4
6.0
Health care cost increase rate:
Following year
8.0
8.5

5.0
The weighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 6.0 percent, 6.1 percent and 5.7 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
The discount rate assumption for the Companys unfunded other postretirement benefit plans is determined by using a model consisting of bond portfolios that match the cash flows of the plans
projected benefit payments. Use of the rate produced by this model generates a projected benefit obligation that equals the current market value of a portfolio of high-quality zero-coupon bonds whose maturity dates and amounts match the timing and
amount of expected future benefit payments. 
A one percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS 
Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to American
Express total credit exposure. The Companys customers operate in diverse industries, economic sectors and geographic regions. 
The

All other primarily includes cardmember receivables from other corporate institutions. 
(e)
Certain distinctions between categories require management judgment. 
(f)
Because charge card products have no preset spending limit, the associated credit limit on cardmember receivables is not quantifiable. Therefore, the quantified unused
line-of-credit amounts only include the approximate credit line available on cardmember loans (including both for on-balance sheet loans and loans previously securitized).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY 
As of December 31, 2009, the Companys most significant concentration of credit risk was with individuals, including cardmember
receivables and loans. These amounts are generally advanced on an unsecured basis. However, the Company reviews each potential customers credit application and evaluates the applicants financial history and ability and willingness to
repay. The Company also considers credit performance by customer tenure, industry, and geographic location in managing credit exposure. The following table details the Companys cardmember loans and receivables exposure (including unused
lines-of-credit on cardmember loans) in the United States and International, as of December 31:

EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY 
The Company has multiple co-brand relationships and rewards partners, of which airlines are one of the most important and valuable. The Companys largest airline co-brand is Delta Air Lines (Delta)
and this relationship includes exclusive co-brand credit card partnerships and other arrangements, including Membership Rewards, merchant acceptance and travel. American Express Delta SkyMiles Credit Card co-brand portfolio accounts for
approximately 5 percent of the Companys worldwide billed business and less than 15 percent of worldwide cardmember lending receivables. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of prepaid miles acquired
from Delta. 
Over the last couple of years, there were a significant number of airline bankruptcies and liquidations, driven in
part by volatile fuel costs and weakening economies around the world. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant revenue declines when a particular airline scales back or ceases operations due to a bankruptcy or other financial
challenges because volumes generated by that airline are typically shifted to other participants in the industry that accept the Companys card products. The Companys exposure to business and credit risk in the airline industry is
primarily through business arrangements where the Company has remitted payment to the airline for a cardmember purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown. The Company mitigates this risk by delaying payment to the airlines
with deteriorating financial situations, thereby increasing cash withheld to protect the Company in the event the airline is liquidated. To date, the Company has not experienced significant losses from airlines that have ceased operations.

NOTE 23 
REGULATORY MATTERS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
The Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve and is subject to the Federal
Reserves requirements for risk-based capital and leverage ratios. The Companys two U.S. Bank operating subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and FSB (collectively, the Banks), are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements of
the FDIC and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). 
The Federal Reserves guidelines for capital adequacy define two
categories of risk-based capital: Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital (as defined in the regulations). Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, the Company is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2)
capital to risk weighted assets, as well as a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets). 
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators, that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Companys and the Banks
financial statements. 
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company and its Banks were well-capitalized and met all
capital requirements to which each was subject. Management is not aware of any events subsequent to December 31, 2009 that would materially, adversely affect the Companys and the Banks 2009 capital ratios, including the impact of
the adoption of changes in GAAP governing the accounting for transfers of financial assets effective January 1, 2010, as discussed in Note 1. While the adoption of these new accounting standards is expected to result in a reduction of the
Companys capital ratios, such ratios are expected to be above applicable well-capitalized levels.

Account Master Trust used to securitize credit card receivables issued by both the FSB and Centurion Bank. As a result of these enhancements, the Banks began holding capital against their off balance sheet trust assets. The Company infused $1.4
billion and $475 million of additional capital into FSB and Centurion Bank, respectively, during 2009 and in connection with the foregoing increased capital commitment for FSB and the impact of the trust enhancements for both FSB and Centurion Bank.

(d)
Represents requirements for banking subsidiaries to be considered well capitalized pursuant to regulations issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act. There is no well capitalized definition for the Tier 1 leverage ratio for a bank holding company. 
RESTRICTED NET ASSETS OF SUBSIDIARIES 
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the transfer of net assets under debt agreements and regulatory requirements. These restrictions have not had any effect on the Companys shareholder dividend
policy and management does not anticipate any impact in the future. Procedures exist to transfer net assets between the Company and its subsidiaries, while ensuring compliance with the various contractual and regulatory constraints. At
December 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of net assets of subsidiaries that are restricted to be transferred to American Express Parent Company (Parent Company) was approximately $9.5 billion. 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 
The Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends by its regulators who could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies
should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of net income attributable to common shareholders over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations current and expected future capital
needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine a companys ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. 
BANKS DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 
In the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, Centurion Bank paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $650 million and $700 million, respectively, which were eliminated in the Companys consolidation. No dividends
were paid in 2009. In the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, FSB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $150 million and $150 million, respectively, which were eliminated in the Companys consolidation. No dividends
were paid in 2009. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Banks could pay, in the aggregate, $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, in dividends to their bank holding companies without the prior approval of their respective banking
regulators. In determining the dividends, the Banks must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings,
including class actions, concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their respective business activities. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them vigorously. In the
course of its business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to governmental examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries, and investigations. The Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its
properties the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration, regulatory, tax or investigative proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, it is possible that the
outcome of any such proceedings could have a material impact on results of operations in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved. 
VISA AND MASTERCARD SETTLEMENTS 
As previously disclosed the Company reached
settlement agreements with Visa and MasterCard. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company will receive aggregate maximum payments of $4.05 billion. The settlement with Visa comprised an initial payment of $1.13 billion ($700 million
after-tax) that was recorded as a gain in 2007. Having met quarterly performance criteria, the Company recognized $280 million ($172 million after-tax) from Visa in 2009 and 2008, and $600 million ($372 million after-tax) and $300 million ($186
million after-tax) from MasterCard in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remaining Visa and MasterCard quarterly payments, subject to the Company achieving certain quarterly performance criteria, continue through the fourth and second quarters of
2011, respectively, and are included in other, net expenses within the Corporate & Other segment. 
The Company also
has contingent obligations to make payments under contractual agreements entered into as part of the ongoing operation of the Companys business, primarily with co-brand partners. The contingent obligations under such arrangements were
approximately $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2009. 
The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
noncancelable and cancelable agreements. The total rental expense amounted to $362 million in 2009 including lease termination penalties of $36 million. Rent expense was $337 million and $300 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of
December 31, 2009, the minimum aggregate rental commitment under all noncancelable operating leases (net of subleases of $5 million) was:

REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS 
REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS 
The Company is a leading global payments and travel company that is principally engaged in
businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Card Services (USCS), International Card Services (ICS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS). 
The Company considers a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of its reportable operating segments, including the results
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily U.S. versus international), and regulatory environment
considerations. Based on these factors, the Company has the following four reportable operating segments: 
USCS issues a wide range of card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the United States, and provides consumer travel services to
cardmembers and other consumers. 
ICS issues proprietary consumer and small business cards outside the United States. 
GCS offers global corporate payment and travel-related products and services to large and mid-sized companies. 
GNMS segment operates a global general-purpose charge and credit card network, which includes both proprietary cards and cards issued under network
partnership agreements. It also manages merchant services globally, which includes signing merchants to accept cards as well as processing and settling card transactions for those merchants. This segment also offers merchants point-of-sale products,
servicing and settlements and marketing programs. 
Corporate functions and auxiliary businesses, including the Companys
publishing business, the Global Prepaid business, as well as other company operations are included in Corporate & Other.

The Company changed the manner by which it assesses the performance of its reportable operating segments to exclude the impact of its excess liquidity funding levels.
Accordingly, beginning in 2009, the debt and cash and investment balances associated with the Companys excess liquidity funding and the related net negative interest spread are no longer included within the reportable operating segment results
(primarily USCS and GCS segments) and are reported in the Corporate & Other segment. The segment results for the prior years have not been revised for this change. The impact on segment income from continuing operations was an increase to
USCS, ICS, and GCS of $101 million, $1 million and $41 million, respectively, and a decrease to Corporate & Other of $143 million for the year ending December 31, 2009. The impact on reportable operating segment asset and liability
balances for this change was a decrease to USCS and GCS of $19 billion and $7 billion, respectively, and an increase to Corporate & Other of $26 billion as of December 31, 2009.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 
The Company allocates discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Segments earn discount revenue based on the volume of merchant business generated by
cardmembers. Within the USCS, ICS and GCS segments, discount revenue reflects the issuer component of the overall discount rate; within the GNMS segment, discount revenue reflects the network and merchant component of the overall discount rate.
Total interest income and net card fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.

segment based on actual expenses incurred within each segment. Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses, such as professional services, occupancy and equipment, and communications, incurred directly within each
segment. In addition, expenses related to the Companys support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff
group support functions, are allocated from Corporate & Other to the other segments based on each segments relative level of pretax income, with the exception of certain fourth quarter 2008 severance and other related charges of $133
million from the Companys fourth quarter restructuring initiatives for staff group support functions. This presentation is consistent with how such charges were reported internally. See further discussion in Note 16 regarding this corporate
initiative. Financing requirements are managed on a consolidated basis. Funding costs are allocated based on segment funding requirements. 
Capital 
Each business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk
measures, and regulatory capital requirements. Business model operating requirements include capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures include considerations for credit, market, and operational risk.

Income Taxes 
Income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to various businesses that make up the segment.

(a)
In 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its international banking subsidiary, AEB, and its subsidiary that issues investment certificates to AEBs
customers, AEIDC, to Standard Chartered subject to certain regulatory approvals. The results, assets, and liabilities of AEB (except for certain components of the business which were not sold) are presented as discontinued operations. Additionally,
the spin-off of Ameriprise and certain dispositions were completed in 2006 and 2005, and the results of these operations are presented as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on discontinued operations.

(b)
Return on average equity is calculated by dividing one year period of net income by one year average of total shareholders equity. 
(c)
Effective January 1, 2009, guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities requires that
restricted stock awards be included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Accordingly, the Company has retrospectively adjusted EPS for all prior periods presented. Refer to Note 18 to the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 
(d)
The market price per share beginning with the fourth quarter of 2005 reflects the spin-off of Ameriprise as of September 30, 2005. The opening share price on the
first trading day after the spin-off was $50.75. 
(e)
Amounts include employees from discontinued operations.

co-brand relationships and rewards partners, of which airlines are
one of the most important and valuable. The Company&#x2019;s largest
airline co-brand is Delta Air Lines (Delta) and this relationship
includes exclusive co-brand credit card partnerships and other
arrangements, including Membership Rewards, merchant acceptance and
travel. American Express&#x2019; Delta SkyMiles Credit Card co-brand
portfolio accounts for approximately 5 percent of the
Company&#x2019;s worldwide billed business and less than 15 percent

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Over the last
couple of years, there were a significant number of airline
bankruptcies and liquidations, driven in part by volatile fuel
costs and weakening economies around the world. Historically, the
Company has not experienced significant revenue declines when a
particular airline scales back or ceases operations due to a
bankruptcy or other financial challenges because volumes generated
by that airline are typically shifted to other participants in the
industry that accept the Company&#x2019;s card products. The
Company&#x2019;s exposure to business and credit risk in the airline
industry is primarily through business arrangements where the
Company has remitted payment to the airline for a cardmember
purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or
&#x201C;flown&#x201D;. The Company mitigates this risk by delaying
payment to the airlines with deteriorating financial situations,
thereby increasing cash withheld to protect the Company in the
event the airline is liquidated. To date, the Company has not
experienced significant losses from airlines that have ceased
operations.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Realized losses are
recognized when management determines that a decline in value is
other-than-temporary. Such determination requires judgment
regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews
and evaluates its investments at least quarterly and more often, as
market conditions may require, to identify investments that have
indications of other-than-temporary impairments. The determination
of other-than-temporary impairment is a subjective process,
requiring the use of judgments and assumptions. It is reasonably
possible that a change in estimate will occur in the near term
relating to other-than- temporary impairment. Accordingly, the
Company considers several factors when evaluating debt securities
for an other-than-temporary impairment including the determination
of the extent to which the decline in fair value of the security is
due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market
interest rate risk. With respect to increased default risk, the
Company assesses the collectibility of principal and interest
payments by monitoring issuers&#x2019; credit ratings, related
changes to those ratings, specific credit events associated with
the individual issuers as well as the credit ratings of a financial
guarantor, where applicable, and the extent to which amortized cost
exceeds fair value and the duration and size of that difference.
With respect to market interest rate risk, including benchmark
interest rates and credit spreads, the Company assesses whether it
has the intent to sell the securities, and whether it is more
likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the
securities before recovery of any unrealized losses.</font></p>

Subordinated Debentures that accrue interest at an annual rate of
6.80 percent until September&#xA0;1, 2016, and at an annual rate of
three-month LIBOR plus 2.23 percent thereafter. At the
Company&#x2019;s option, the Subordinated Debentures are redeemable
for cash after September&#xA0;1, 2016 at 100 percent of the
principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest. If the
Company fails to achieve specified performance measures, it will be
required to issue its common shares and apply the net proceeds to
make interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures. No dividends
on the Company&#x2019;s common or preferred shares could be paid
until such interest payments are made. The Company would fail to
meet these specific performance measures if (i)&#xA0;the
Company&#x2019;s tangible common equity is less than 4 percent of
total adjusted assets for the most recent quarter or (ii)&#xA0;if
the trailing two quarters&#x2019; consolidated net income is equal

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">General principles and the
overall framework for managing market risk across the Company are
defined in the Market Risk Policy, which is the responsibility of
the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO). Market risk limits and
escalation triggers in that policy are approved by the ALCO and by
the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC). Market risk
is centrally managed by the Market Risk Committee, which reports
into the ALCO and is chaired by the Chief Market Risk Officer of
the Company. Market risk management is also guided by policies
covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding and
liquidity and investments. Derivative financial instruments derive
their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables,
including interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity indices or
prices. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or
alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an
integral component of the Company&#x2019;s market risk
management.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The
Company&#x2019;s market exposures are in large part by-products of
the delivery of its products and services. Interest rate risk
arises through the funding of cardmember receivables and fixed-rate
loans with variable-rate borrowings as well as through the risk to
net interest margin from changes in the relationship between
benchmark rates such as Prime and LIBOR.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Interest rate
exposure within the Company&#x2019;s charge card and fixed-rate
lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total
funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits
compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest
rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert
fixed-rate debt to variable-rate or to convert variable-rate debt
to fixed rate. The Company may change the mix between variable-rate
and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and
mix, among other factors. The majority of its cardmember loans,
which are linked to a benchmark rate such as Prime that can reprice
monthly, are funded with variable-rate funding, the majority of
which are linked to LIBOR.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Foreign
exchange risk is generated by cardmember cross-currency charges,
foreign currency balance sheet exposures, translation of foreign
subsidiary equity, and foreign currency earnings in international
units. The Company&#x2019;s foreign exchange risk is managed
primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on
a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is
economically justified through various means, including the use of
derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward,
options, and cross-currency swap contracts, which can help
&#x201C;lock in&#x201D; the value of the Company&#x2019;s exposure to
specific currencies. The Company does not engage in derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Derivative
financial instruments may contain counterparty credit risk. The
Company manages this risk by considering the current exposure,
which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date,
as well as estimating the maximum potential value of the contracts
over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility
of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit
risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved and rated as
investment grade. Counterparty risk exposures are monitored by the
Company&#x2019;s Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC). The
IRMC formally reviews large institutional exposures to ensure
compliance with the Company&#x2019;s ERMC guidelines and procedures
and determines the risk mitigation actions, when necessary.
Additionally, to mitigate counterparty credit risk the Company may,
on occasion, enter into master netting agreements.</font></p>

December&#xA0;31, 2009 and 2008, the counterparty credit risk
associated with the Company&#x2019;s derivative financial
instruments was not significant. In relation to the Company&#x2019;s

settle any outstanding liability balances, or post collateral upon
the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event.</font></p>

instruments executed for hedge accounting purposes are documented
and designated as such when the Company enters into the contracts.
In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company
structures its hedges with very similar terms to the hedged items.
The Company formally assesses, at inception of the hedge accounting
relationship and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives
designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair
value or cash flows of hedged items. These assessments usually are
made through the application of the regression analysis method. If
it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
hedge, the Company will discontinue the application of hedge
accounting.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">A fair value hedge involves
a derivative designated to hedge the Company&#x2019;s exposure to
future changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an
identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular
risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with
its fixed-rate long-term debt. The Company uses interest rate swaps
to convert certain fixed-rate long-term debt to floating-rate at
the time of issuance. As of December&#xA0;31, 2009 and 2008, the
Company hedged $15.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, of
its fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt using interest rate
swaps.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">To the extent
the fair value hedge is effective, the gain or loss on the hedging
instrument offsets the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable
to the hedged risk. Any difference between the changes in the fair
value of the derivative and the hedged item is referred to as hedge
ineffectiveness and is recorded in earnings as a component of
other, net expenses. Hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by
differences between the debt&#x2019;s interest coupon and the
benchmark rate, which is in turn primarily due to credit spreads at
inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the
valuation of the interest rate swap. Furthermore, hedge
ineffectiveness may be caused by changes in the relationship
between 3-month LIBOR and 1-month LIBOR rates, as these so-called
basis spreads may impact the valuation of the interest rate swap
without causing an offsetting impact in the value of the hedged
debt. If a fair value hedge is de-designated or no longer

financial instruments that act as economic hedges and are not
designated for hedge accounting purposes. Foreign currency
transactions and non-U.S. dollar cash flow exposures from time to
time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign
currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards, options,
and cross-currency swaps. These hedges generally mature within one
year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of a
designated currency at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a
specified date. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives
effectively offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses on
the underlying balance sheet exposures. From time to time, the
Company may enter into interest rate swaps to specifically manage
funding costs related to its proprietary card business.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company has
certain operating agreements whose payments may be linked to a
market rate or price, primarily foreign currency rates. The payment
components of these agreements may meet the definition of an
embedded derivative, which is assessed to determine if it requires
separate accounting and reporting. If so, the embedded derivative
is accounted for separately and is classified as a foreign exchange
contract based on its primary risk exposure. In addition, the
Company also holds an investment security containing an embedded
equity-linked derivative.</font></p>

security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades
and broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of
transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to
the pricing models used. In addition, the Company did not apply any
adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. The
Company classifies the prices obtained from the pricing services
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the underlying
inputs are directly observable from active markets or recent trades
of similar securities in inactive markets. However, the pricing
models used do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and
therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are
modeled could result in different estimates of fair
value.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company determines the
fair value of its retained subordinated securities using discounted
cash flow models. The discount rate used is based on an interest
rate curve that is observable in the marketplace plus an
unobservable credit spread commensurate with the risk of these
securities and similar financial instruments. The Company
classifies such securities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
because the applicable credit spreads are not observable due to the
illiquidity in the market with respect to these securities and
similar financial instruments. Refer to Note 7 for additional fair

interest-only strip is the present value of estimated future
positive excess spread expected to be generated by the securitized
loans over the estimated remaining life of those loans. Management
utilizes certain estimates and assumptions to determine the fair
value of the interest-only strip asset, including estimates for
finance charge yield, credit losses, London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) (which determines future certificate interest costs),
monthly payment rate and discount rate. On a quarterly basis, the
Company compares the assumptions it uses in calculating the fair
value of its interest-only strip to observable market data when
available, and to historical trends. The interest-only strip is
classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the
significance of the unobservable inputs used in valuing this asset.

Company&#x2019;s derivative financial instruments, which could be
assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is
estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses
proprietary pricing models, or by using internal pricing models,
neither of which contain a high level of subjectivity as the
valuation techniques used do not require significant judgment and
inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted
markets. In each case, the valuation models used are consistently
applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives,
including the period of maturity, and market-based parameters such
as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or
prices, and volatility.</font></p>

valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters (for

exposure. Refer to Note 12 for additional fair value

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company,
its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries, and certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The
Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its
states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in
which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex, and the
manner in which they apply to the taxpayer&#x2019;s facts is
sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent
complexities, the Company must make judgments in assessing the
likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination
by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax
position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on
management&#x2019;s judgment regarding the application of income tax
laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for
financial reporting purposes is based on management&#x2019;s best
judgment of the most likely outcome resulting from examination
given the facts, circumstances and information available at the
reporting date. The Company adjusts the level of unrecognized tax
benefits when there is new information available to assess the
likelihood of the outcome.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Included in the $1.1
billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits
at December&#xA0;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are
approximately $480 million, $452&#xA0;million and $597 million,
respectively that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate in a future period. These benefits primarily
relate to the Company&#x2019;s gross permanent benefits and
corresponding foreign tax credits and federal tax
effects.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company
believes it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax
benefits could decrease within the next 12&#xA0;months by as much
as $580 million principally as a result of potential resolutions of
prior years&#x2019; tax items with various taxing authorities. The
prior years&#x2019; tax items include unrecognized tax benefits
relating to the timing of recognition of certain gross income, the
deductibility of certain expenses or losses, and the attribution of
taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of
the $580 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $318
million are temporary differences that, if recognized, would only
impact the effective rate due to net interest assessments and state
tax rate differentials. With respect to the remaining decrease of
$262 million, it is not possible to quantify the impact that the
decrease could have on the effective tax rate and net income due to
the inherent complexities and the number of tax years open for
examination in multiple jurisdictions.&#xA0;Resolution of the prior
years&#x2019; items that comprise this remaining amount could have
an impact on the effective tax rate and on net income, either
favorably (principally as a result of settlements that are less
than the liability for unrecognized tax benefits) or unfavorably
(if such settlements exceed the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits).</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Interest and
penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in
income tax provision. During the years ended December&#xA0;31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized approximately $1
million, $60 million and $17 million, respectively, of interest and
penalties. The Company has approximately $282 million and $285
million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of
December&#xA0;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.</font></p>

RECEIVABLES</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Cardmember receivables
represent amounts due from charge card customers. These receivables
are recorded at the time a cardmember enters into a point-of-sale

presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for
losses, discussed below, and includes principal and any related

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Reserves for losses
relating to cardmember receivables represent management&#x2019;s
best estimate of the losses inherent in the Company&#x2019;s
outstanding portfolio of receivables. Management&#x2019;s evaluation
process requires certain estimates and judgments. Reserves for
these losses are primarily based upon models that analyze portfolio
performance and reflect management&#x2019;s judgment regarding
overall reserve adequacy. The analytic models take into account
several factors, including average losses and recoveries over an
appropriate historical period. Management considers whether to
adjust the analytic models for specific factors such as increased
risk in certain portfolios, impact of risk management initiatives
on portfolio performance and concentration of credit risk based on
factors such as tenure, industry or geographic regions. In
addition, management adjusts the reserves for losses for other
external environmental factors such as leading economic and market
indicators, and the legal and regulatory environment. Generally,
due to the short-term nature of cardmember receivables, the impact
of the other external environmental factors on the inherent losses
within the cardmember receivable portfolio is not significant. As
part of this evaluation process, management also considers various
reserve coverage metrics, such as reserves as a percentage of
past-due amounts, reserves as a percentage of cardmember
receivables and net write-off coverage.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Cardmember
receivables balances are written off when management deems amounts
to be uncollectible and is generally determined by the number of
days past due. Cardmember receivables within the U.S. Card Services
(USCS) segment are generally written off when 180 days past due and
cardmember receivables within the International Card Services (ICS)
and Global Commercial Services (GCS) segments are generally written
off when 360 days past billing. Receivables in bankruptcy or owed
by deceased individuals are written off upon notification.
Recoveries are recognized on a cash basis.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Prior to the
fourth quarter of 2008, cardmember receivables in the USCS segment
were written off when 360 days past billing. During 2008,
consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance, the Company
modified its write-off methodology to write off cardmember
receivables in the USCS segment when 180 days past due. Net
cardmember receivables write-offs in 2008 included approximately
$341 million resulting from this change in write-off
methodology.</font></p>

program allows enrolled cardmembers to earn points that can be
redeemed for a broad range of rewards, including travel,
entertainment, retail certificates, and merchandise. The Company
establishes balance sheet liabilities which represent the estimated
cost of points earned to date that are ultimately expected to be
redeemed. These liabilities reflect management&#x2019;s best
estimate of future redemption costs. An ultimate redemption rate
and weighted average cost per point are key factors used to
approximate the Membership Reward liability. Management uses models
to estimate ultimate redemption rates based on historical
redemption data, card product type, year of program enrollment,
enrollment tenure and card spend levels. The weighted-average cost
per point is determined using actual redemptions during the
previous 12 months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in
redemption costs.</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company&#x2019;s
significant defined benefit pension plans cover certain employees
in the United States and United Kingdom. Most employees outside the
United States and United Kingdom are covered by local retirement
plans, some of which are funded, while other employees receive
payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable
labor laws or agreements. The Company complies with the minimum
funding requirements in all countries.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company
sponsors the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan (the Plan) for
eligible employees in the United States. The Plan is a
noncontributory defined benefit plan and a tax-qualified retirement
plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (ERISA). Effective July&#xA0;1, 2007, the Plan was
closed to new entrants and existing participants no longer accrue
future benefits. The Company funds retirement costs through a trust
and complies with the applicable minimum funding requirements
specified by ERISA, as revised under the Pension Protection Act
(PPA), effective October&#xA0;1, 2008. The funded status of the
Plan on an ERISA basis as of October&#xA0;1, 2009 (applicable plan
year) is 106 percent. The PPA calculation assumptions are specific
to ERISA and differ from the calculation of the net funded status
for GAAP purposes (see Net Funded Status as of December&#xA0;31,
2009 in the table below).</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Plan is a
cash balance plan and employees&#x2019; accrued benefits are based
on notional account balances, which are maintained for each
individual. Employees&#x2019; balances are credited daily with
interest at a fixed-rate that is updated each January&#xA0;1 and is
based on the average of the daily five-year U.S. Treasury Note
yields for the previous October&#xA0;1 through November&#xA0;30.
The interest rate varies from a minimum of 5 percent to a maximum
equal to the lesser of (i)&#xA0;10 percent or (ii)&#xA0;the
applicable interest rate set forth in the Plan. Employees and their
beneficiaries have the option to receive annuity payments upon
retirement or a lump-sum payout at vested termination, death,
disability or retirement.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company
also sponsors an unfunded non-qualified Supplemental Retirement
Plan (the SRP) for employees compensated above a certain level to
supplement their pension benefits that are limited by the Internal
Revenue Code. The SRP was also amended as of July&#xA0;1, 2007, and
its terms generally parallel those of the Plan, except that the
definition of compensation and payment options differ.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">For each plan,
the net funded status is defined by GAAP governing retirement
benefits as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
and the respective plan&#x2019;s projected benefit obligation. The
projected benefit obligation represents a liability based on the
plan participants&#x2019; service-to-date and their expected future
compensation at their projected retirement date. Changes in the
funded status are recorded as unamortized gains and losses, which
are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
periods in which they occur along with prior service
cost.</font></p>

benefit payments based on the plan participants&#x2019; service to
date and their expected future compensation. Use of the rate

Investment Committee (BPIC) is appointed by the Compensation and
Benefits Committee of the Company&#x2019;s Board of Directors and
has the responsibility of reviewing and approving the investment
policies related to plan assets for the Company&#x2019;s defined
benefit pension plans; evaluating the performance of the
investments in accordance with the investment policy; reviewing the
investment objectives, risk, characteristics, expenses and
historical performance; and selecting and evaluating the investment
managers. The BPIC typically meets quarterly to review the
performance of the various investment managers and service
providers as well as other investment related matters. The
Company&#x2019;s significant defined benefit pension plans have
investment policies, which prescribe targets for the amount of
assets that can be invested in a security class in order to
mitigate the detrimental impact of adverse or unexpected results
with respect to any individual security class on the overall
portfolio. The portfolios are diversified by asset type, risk
characteristics and concentration of investments.</font></p>

CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company sponsors
defined contribution retirement plans, the principal plan being the
Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), a 401(k) savings plan with a profit
sharing component. The RSP is a tax-qualified retirement plan
subject to ERISA and covers most employees in the U. S. Under the
terms of the RSP, employees have the option of investing up to 10
percent of their contributions in the American Express Company
Stock Fund, which invests primarily in the Company&#x2019;s common
stock, through accumulated payroll deductions. Employees are
restricted from transferring balances into this fund if the balance
has reached 10 percent of the employee&#x2019;s total account
balance. The RSP held 13&#xA0;million shares of American Express
Common Stock at both December&#xA0;31, 2009 and 2008, beneficially
for employees. Effective July&#xA0;1, 2007, the Company matches
employee contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 5 percent of
total pay. Additional annual conversion contributions of up to 8
percent of total pay are provided into the RSP for eligible
employees who were hired before April&#xA0;1, 2007. The Company
also sponsors an RSP SRP, which is an unfunded non-qualified plan
for employees whose RSP benefits are limited by the Internal
Revenue Code and its terms generally parallel those of the RSP,
except that the definition of compensation and payment options
differ.</font></p>

expense for all defined contribution retirement plans globally was
$118 million, $211 million and $173 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The decrease in defined contribution expense in 2009
primarily reflects the Company&#x2019;s temporary suspension of the
employer match conversion contributions (reinstated prospectively
in January 2010).</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">During 2009, the Company
recorded $185 million of restructuring charges, net of adjustments
of previously accrued amounts due to revisions of prior estimates.
The 2009 activity primarily relates to the $199 million of
restructuring charges the Company recorded in the second quarter to
further reduce its operating costs by downsizing and reorganizing
certain operations. These restructuring activities were for the
elimination of approximately 4,000 positions or about 6 percent of
the Company&#x2019;s total worldwide workforce and occurred across
all business units, markets and staff groups. Additional
restructuring charges of $38 million taken in the third and fourth
quarters of 2009 relate principally to the reorganization of
certain senior leadership positions, as well as the exit of a
business in the Global Network&#xA0;&amp; Merchant Services (GNMS)
segment. The Company also recorded adjustments of $(52) million
during 2009 that primarily relate to revisions of prior estimates
for higher employee redeployments to other positions within the
Company, business changes and modifications to existing
initiatives. These modifications do not constitute a significant
change in the original restructuring plan from an overall Company
perspective.</font></p>

<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">During 2008,
the Company recorded restructuring charges of $434 million, net of
adjustments of previously accrued amounts due to revisions of prior
estimates. While the Company&#x2019;s restructuring activity in the
first and third quarters of 2008 primarily related to exiting
certain international banking businesses, the Company recorded $410
million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 in
order to further reduce the Company&#x2019;s cost structure. This
restructuring was for the elimination of approximately 7,000
positions or approximately 10 percent of its total worldwide
workforce. These reductions primarily occurred across business
units, markets and staff groups focusing on management and other
positions that do not interact directly with customers, and related
to reorganizing or automating certain internal processes;
outsourcing certain operations to third parties; and discontinuing
or relocating business activities to other locations. During 2007,
the Company recorded restructuring charges of $49 million, net of
adjustments of previously accrued amounts due to revisions of prior
estimates, primarily related to the reorganizations within the
Company&#x2019;s business travel, operations, finance, and
technology areas.</font></p>

relating to cardmember loans represent management&#x2019;s best
estimate of the losses inherent in the Company&#x2019;s outstanding
portfolio of loans. Management&#x2019;s evaluation process requires
certain estimates and judgments. Reserves for these losses are
primarily based upon models that analyze portfolio performance and
reflect management&#x2019;s judgment regarding overall reserve
adequacy. The analytic models take into account several factors,
including average losses and recoveries over an appropriate
historical period. Management considers whether to adjust the
analytic models for specific factors such as increased risk in
certain portfolios, impact of risk management initiatives on
portfolio performance and concentration of credit risk based on
factors such as tenure, industry or geographic regions. In
addition, management adjusts the reserves for losses for other
external environmental factors including leading economic and
market indicators such as the unemployment rate, GDP, home price
indices, non-farm payrolls, personal consumption expenditures
index, consumer confidence index, purchasing manager&#x2019;s index,
bankruptcy filings and the legal and regulatory environment. As
part of this evaluation process, management also considers various
reserve coverage metrics, such as reserves as a percentage of
past-due amounts, reserves as a percentage of cardmember loans and
net write-off coverage.</font></p>

larger balance or smaller balance homogeneous restructured loans

unable to collect all amounts due according to the original
contractual terms of the loan and receivable agreement. The Company
may modify cardmember loans and receivables and such modifications
may include reducing the interest rate/delinquency fees on the
loans and receivables and/or placing the cardmember on a fixed
payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the cardmember does not
comply with the modified terms, then the loan or receivable
agreement reverts back to its original terms. Impaired loans and
receivables include long-term modification programs or Troubled
Debt Restructurings (TDR), wherein the terms of a loan or
receivable have been modified for cardmembers that are experiencing
financial difficulties and a long-term concession (more than 12
months) has been granted to the borrower. TDRs totaled $114 million
and $71 million of cardmember loans and receivables outstanding as
of December&#xA0;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Reserves for
losses for TDRs is determined by the difference between cash flows
expected to be received from the cardmember discounted at the
original contractual interest rates and the carrying value of the
cardmember balance.</font></p>

manner by which it assesses the performance of its reportable
operating segments to exclude the impact of its excess liquidity
funding levels. Accordingly, beginning in 2009, the debt and cash
and investment balances associated with the Company&#x2019;s excess
liquidity funding and the related net negative interest spread are
no longer included within the reportable operating segment results
(primarily USCS and GCS segments) and are reported in the
Corporate&#xA0;&amp; Other segment. The segment results for the
prior years have not been revised for this change. The impact on
segment income from continuing operations was an increase to USCS,
ICS, and GCS of $101 million, $1 million and $41 million,
respectively, and a decrease to Corporate&#xA0;&amp; Other of $143
million for the year ending December&#xA0;31, 2009. The impact on
reportable operating segment asset and liability balances for this
change was a decrease to USCS and GCS of $19 billion and $7
billion, respectively, and an increase to Corporate&#xA0;&amp;
Other of $26 billion as of December&#xA0;31, 2009.</font></td>

discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a
transfer pricing methodology. Segments earn discount revenue based
on the volume of merchant business generated by cardmembers. Within
the USCS, ICS and GCS segments, discount revenue reflects the
issuer component of the overall discount rate; within the GNMS
segment, discount revenue reflects the network and merchant

rewards and cardmember services expenses are reflected in each
segment based on actual expenses incurred, with the exception of
brand advertising, which is reflected in the GNMS segment. Rewards
and cardmember services expenses are reflected in each segment
based on actual expenses incurred within each segment. Salaries and
employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses,
such as professional services, occupancy and equipment, and
communications, incurred directly within each segment. In addition,
expenses related to the Company&#x2019;s support services, such as
technology costs, are allocated to each segment based on support
service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other
overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are
allocated from Corporate&#xA0;&amp; Other to the other segments
based on each segment&#x2019;s relative level of pretax income, with
the exception of certain fourth quarter 2008 severance and other
related charges of $133 million from the Company&#x2019;s fourth
quarter restructuring initiatives for staff group support
functions. This presentation is consistent with how such charges
were reported internally. See further discussion in Note 16
regarding this corporate initiative. Financing requirements are
managed on a consolidated basis. Funding costs are allocated based
on segment funding&#xA0;requirements.</font></p>

comprehensive (loss) income, a component of shareholders&#x2019;
equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax
effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial
liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Revenues and
expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates
during the year. Gains and losses related to transactions in a
currency other than the functional currency, including operations
outside the U.S. where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar,
are reported net, in the Company&#x2019;s Consolidated Statements of
Income, in other non-interest revenue, interest income, interest
expense, or other, net expense, depending on the nature of the
activity. Net foreign currency transaction gains amounted to
approximately $205&#xA0;million, $15 million and $27 million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 19 for further
discussion of certain items that impacted these gains in
2009.</font></p>

concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions
are those that relate to reserves for cardmember losses relating to
loans and charge card receivables, reserves for Membership Rewards
cost, fair value measurements, goodwill and income taxes. These
accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but
actual results could differ.</font></p>

fees charged to merchants with which the Company, or its franchise

recognized on a straight-line basis over the 12-month card
membership period, net of deferred direct card acquisition costs
and a reserve for projected membership cancellations. Charge card
fees are recognized in net card fees in the Consolidated Statements
of Income and the unamortized net card fee balance is reported in
other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note
11). Loan product fees are considered an enhancement to the yield
on the product, and are recognized in interest and fees on loans in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee
balance for lending products is reported net in cardmember loans on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 5).</font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">The Company earns travel
commissions and fees by charging clients transaction or management
fees for selling and arranging travel and travel management
services. Client transaction fee revenue is recognized at the time
the client books the travel arrangements. Travel management
services revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the
agreement. The Company&#x2019;s travel suppliers (for example,
airlines, hotels, car rental companies) pay commissions and fees on
tickets issued, sales and other services based on contractual
agreements. Commissions and fees from travel suppliers are
generally recognized at the time a ticket is purchased or over the
term of the contract. Commissions and fees that are based on actual
usage that is unknown at time of purchase (for example, hotel and
car rentals) are recognized when cash is received.</font></p>

primarily in the period in which they are charged to the
cardmember. Also included are fees related to the Company&#x2019;s
Membership Rewards program, which are deferred and recognized over
the period covered by the fee. The unamortized Membership Rewards
fee balance is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated

payments through contractual arrangements with merchants,
Commercial Card clients and certain other customers, collectively
the &#x201C;customers&#x201D;. Payments to customers are generally
classified as contra-revenue unless a specifically identifiable
benefit (e.g. goods or services) is received by the Company in
consideration for that payment and the fair value of such benefit
is determinable and measurable. If no such benefit is identified,
then the entire payment is classified as contra-revenue, and
included within total non-interest revenues in the Consolidated
Statements of Income in the line item where the related transaction
revenues are recorded (e.g. discount revenue, travel commissions
and fees, and other commissions and fees). If such a benefit is
identified, then the payment is classified as expense up to the
estimated fair value of the benefit.</font></p>

is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which
adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and
other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on
the investment security&#x2019;s outstanding balance. Amounts are
recognized until such time as a security is in default or when it
is likely that future interest payments will not be made as
scheduled.</font></p>

primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from
customers and institutions, (ii)&#xA0;short-term borrowings, which
primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal

including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are
capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service.
Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of assets, which range from 3 to 8
years for equipment. Premises are depreciated based upon their
estimated useful life at the acquisition date, which generally
ranges from 40 to 60 years.</font></p>

improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over
the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the
economic life of the improvement, which ranges from 5 to 10 years.
The Company maintains operating leases worldwide for facilities and
equipment. Rent expense for facility leases is recognized ratably
over the lease term, and is calculated to include adjustments for
rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement
allowances. The Company accounts for lease restoration obligations
in accordance with applicable GAAP, which requires recognition of
the fair value of restoration liabilities when incurred, and
amortization of capitalized restoration costs over the lease
term.</font></p>

under the accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs. Other
changes include additional considerations when determining if sale
accounting is appropriate, as well as enhanced disclosure

that it will be required to consolidate the American Express Credit
Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) as a result of
implementing these standards. This will result in approximately
$29.0 billion of additional cardmember loans being recognized on
the balance sheet of the Company effective January&#xA0;1, 2010,
along with $25.0 billion of long-term debt. This will also result
in the reduction of the Company&#x2019;s investment securities by
$3.6 billion and other assets by $0.7 billion. The $29.0 billion of
cardmember loans will require associated loan loss reserves of
approximately $2.5 billion, which will be charged directly against
retained earnings. The adjustments described above will reduce
shareholders&#x2019; equity by approximately $1.8 billion on an
after-tax basis. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion of the
Lending Trust.</font></p>

completed in order to adjust the credit enhancement structure of

does not represent management&#x2019;s expectations of adverse
changes in these assumptions but is provided as a hypothetical
scenario to assess the sensitivity of the fair value of the
retained subordinated interests to changes in key inputs.
Management cannot extrapolate changes in fair value based on a 10
percent or 20 percent change in all key assumptions simultaneously
in part because the relationship of the change in one assumption on
the fair value of the retained interest is calculated independently
from any change in another assumption. Changes in one factor may
cause changes in another, which could magnify or offset the

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Goodwill represents the
excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company
assigns goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of
impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating
segment, or a business one level below an operating segment for
which complete, discrete financial information is available that
management regularly reviews. The Company evaluates goodwill for
impairment annually as of June&#xA0;30 and between annual tests if
events occur or circumstances change that more likely than not
reduce the fair value of reporting units below their carrying
amounts. The goodwill impairment test utilizes a two-step approach.
The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying
amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment
test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
Goodwill was not impaired as of December&#xA0;31, 2009 and
2008.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">Goodwill
impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an
assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can
be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit
using widely accepted valuation techniques, such as the market
approach (earnings multiples or transaction multiples) or income
approach (discounted cash flow methods). The fair values of the
reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation
techniques consistent with the income approach and the market
approach.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 2%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
<font style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman" size="2">When preparing
discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company
uses internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to
be generated by the reporting units. Actual results may differ from
forecasted results. The Company uses the expected cost of equity
financing, estimated using a capital asset pricing model, to
discount future cash flows for each reporting unit. The Company
believes the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks
and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and
specifically in the Company&#x2019;s internally developed forecasts.
Further, to assess the reasonableness of the valuations derived
from the discounted cash flow models, the Company also analyzes
market based multiples for similar industries of the reporting
unit, where available.</font></p>
