Item 1A. Risk Factors 
The following risk factor is added to those set forth in the Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2013. Except as described below, the material risks and uncertainties that management believes effect the Corporation have not changed materially from those described in the Form 10-K. 
Acquisitions may be delayed, impeded, or prohibited by regulatory authorities due to regulatory issues.
 Acquisitions by the Corporation,
particularly those of financial institutions, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies (collectively, regulatory approvals). These regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, or denied due to
existing or new regulatory issues the Corporation has, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to AML/BSA compliance, fair lending laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or
practices regulations, Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) issues, and other similar laws and regulations. Problems with acquisitions due to such issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, and, in turn, our financial condition and
results of operations.
