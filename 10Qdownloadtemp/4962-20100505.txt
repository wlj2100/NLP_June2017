ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS 
This section supplements
and updates certain of the information found under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the 2009 Form 10-K) and should be read in conjunction with the
discussion of risk factors set forth in such section. Based on the information currently known to the Company, it believes that the matter discussed below, together with the risk factors set forth in the 2009 Form 10-K, identify the most significant
risk factors affecting the Company. However, the risks and uncertainties that the Company faces are not limited to those described below and those set forth in the 2009 Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company
or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Companys business and the trading price of its securities. 
Our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters. 
As previously disclosed, natural disasters, severe weather conditions and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on the Companys
business. Because the Company derives a portion of its revenues from travel-related spending, its business is sensitive to disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel caused by such events. Such disruptions can result in the payment of
claims under travel interruption insurance policies that the Company offers and, if such disruptions to travel are prolonged, they can materially adversely affect overall travel-related spending. If the conditions described above (or similar ones)
result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
For a
discussion of other risk factors relating to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
