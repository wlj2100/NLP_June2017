Item 1A.
/ Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the following risk
factor as well as the other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors
in our 2014 Annual Report.
Our
restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and
improvements in operational and organizational efficiency.
We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense
reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements we expect
to result from our restructuring initiatives. Actual costs to implement these
initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement
them. The successful implementation of these initiatives will require us to
effect workforce reductions, business rationalizations, systems enhancements
and business dispositions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which
are beyond our control. If we are unable to realize these anticipated expense
reductions and efficiency improvements, our businesses and results of
operations may be adversely affected.
