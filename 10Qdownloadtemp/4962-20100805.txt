ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Item 1A. Risk
Factors of each of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2009 (the 2009 Form 10-K) and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
March 31, 2010 (the 2010 First Quarter Form 10-Q), and should be read in conjunction with the
discussion of risk factors set forth in such sections. Based on the information currently known
to the Company, it believes that the matters discussed below, together with the risk factors set
forth in the 2009 Form 10-K and the 2010 First Quarter Form 10-Q, identify the most significant
risk factors affecting the Company. However, the risks and uncertainties that the Company faces
are not limited to those described below and those set forth in the 2009 Form 10-K and the 2010
First Quarter Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company
or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Companys business
and the trading price of its securities.

Risk Factor
Recent legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act. The Reform Act, as well as other legislative and regulatory changes, could have
a significant adverse impact on the Companys business, results of operations and financial
condition by, for example, requiring the Company to change its business practices, requiring the
Company to comply with more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements,
limiting the Companys ability to pursue business opportunities, imposing additional costs on
the Company (including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through
the issuance of asset-backed securities), limiting the fees the Company can charge for services
and impacting the value of the Companys assets. A description of certain provisions of the
Reform Act and other legislative and regulatory developments is contained in Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCurrent Legislative,
Regulatory and Other Developments.

The Reform Act will result in increased scrutiny and oversight of consumer financial services
and products, primarily through the establishment of a new independent Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau within the Federal Reserve. The Bureau will have broad rulemaking and
enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products. The
impact this new regulatory regime will have on the Companys business is uncertain at this time
and will depend on, among other things, the timing of the Bureaus assumption of its authority
from other governmental agencies, which is expected to occur within six to 18 months of the
enactment of the Reform Act.

Under the Reform Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to
banks on debit card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the
cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit debit card networks and issuers from
requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network. The Reform Act also
prohibits credit/debit network rules that would restrict a merchant from offering discounts to
customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment, as long as such
discounts do not discriminate among issuers or networks, and that would restrict a merchant from
setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards. The impact of these
provisions on the Companys card and network businesses is uncertain at this time and will
depend upon Federal Reserve implementing regulations, the actions of the Companys competitors
and the behavior of other marketplace participants, including cardholders and merchants in the
Companys payment network.

The Reform Act has also eliminated an exception to certain types of liabilities applicable to
rating agencies under the securities laws, which has resulted in the agencies declining to give
their consent to disclose ratings in registered offerings. This circumstance is of particular
significance in offerings of asset-backed securities (ABS offerings), which require ratings
disclosure that, subsequent to the
Reform Act, can be made only with rating agency consent. Although the SEC staff has effectively
relieved issuers from the ratings disclosure requirement through January 2011, if the rating
agencies do not change their position, the Company will not be able to issue ABS securities in
registered offerings after such time, and may have to rely on private offerings to raise funding
through its ABS program.

The Reform Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve to establish heightened capital, leverage and
liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures,
mandatory resolution plans (so-called living wills) and stress tests for, among others, large
bank holding companies, such as the Company, that have greater than $50 billion in assets.
In addition, most interest rate and currency swaps will be required to be exchange-traded which may increase collateral posting requirements for the Company.

Many provisions of the Reform Act, including numerous provisions not described above, require
the adoption of rules to implement. In addition, the Reform Act mandates multiple studies, which
could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The ultimate consequences,
therefore, of the Reform Act and its implementing regulations on the Companys business, results
of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.

Ongoing legal and governmental
proceedings regarding the Company’s surcharging and
“anti-steering” policies could subject the Company to monetary
judgments, fines, penalties and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses
or loss of revenue.
The U.S. Department of Justice is
investigating the Company’s surcharging and “anti-steering”
policies that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the
Company’s card products in favor of other forms of payment at the point
of sale, and the Company is a defendant in a number of class actions filed by
merchants that also challenge these policies. The Company’s competitor
networks are subject to similar proceedings. An adverse outcome in any of these
proceedings against the Company could adversely impact the profitability of the
Company and require it to change its policies in a way that could expose the
Company’s card products to discrimination or steering at the point of
sale. Even if the Company is not required to change its policies, but its
competitor networks are compelled to change their policies or practices as a
result of the proceedings against them, the Company could be subject to market
pressures that force it to make certain changes to its own policies and
practices, which could adversely impact its profitability.
